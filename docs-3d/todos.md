To Dos

Major Issues
- poops not dropping under guinea pig, they appear in other places

Small Bugs
- can't click to remove poop if inside igloo

UX Improvements
- add colors to guinea pig 
- make some fur patterns

Guinea Pig Menus
- Remove the current floating action buttons connected to clicking the guinea pig
- When we click the guinea pig, we should see a menu (similar to the menu shown on guinea pig click in the 2d Habitat View, but probably larger) that shows the current needs, general info, and the "Take Control" button, friendship info, etc
- Need are not changable (static, not sliders) within this menu
- When "Take Control" is active, clicking in the habitat will make the guinea pig walk to that spot, and it will walk around obstacles. Like the 2d view, it should release control after 30 seconds. The guinea pig should have a different colored highlight ring when being controlled

New Panels
- remove the water bottle rotation panel - this should work solidly now
- add a Manual Triggers panel
- add the button for Trigger Eat only for now
- add the Guinea Pig selection toggle button that is used in the 2d HabitatView

- add Needs panel S
- it will have the needs with changeable sliders (only hunger works for now)
- take styles for all the panels from 2d HabitatView
- add Reset All Needs button to needs panel
- add the Guinea Pig selection toggle button that is used in the 2d HabitatView
