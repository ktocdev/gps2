## Sprint Backlog

### Fix Poop Spawn Position
**Priority:** HIGH (P0)
**Status:** ⏸️ DEFERRED
**Category:** Bug Fix

**Issue:** Poops appear in wrong places instead of dropping under the guinea pig

**Root Cause:** The 3D hunger behavior (`use3DHungerBehavior.ts`) didn't have poop handling. The 2D behavior system was creating poop based on 2D positions which weren't updated in 3D mode.

**Solution:** Added `checkAutonomousPooping()` function to `use3DHungerBehavior.ts` that:
1. Gets guinea pig's world position from `movement3DStore`
2. Converts world position to grid coordinates using `worldToGrid()`
3. Converts grid to subgrid with random offset for visual variety
4. Calls `habitatConditions.addPoop()` with correct coordinates

**Files Modified:**
- [use3DHungerBehavior.ts](../../src/composables/3d/use3DHungerBehavior.ts) - Added poop handling

---

### Fix Poop Click Detection Inside Igloo
**Priority:** HIGH (P0)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Category:** Bug Fix

**Issue:** Can't click to remove poop when it's inside the igloo/shelter

**Root Cause:** Raycaster was only checking the first intersection (`intersects[0]`), so when poop was inside the igloo, the igloo mesh was hit first and blocked poop detection.

**Solution:** Changed poop detection to loop through ALL intersections, not just the first one. This allows clicking "through" the igloo to reach poop inside.

**Files Modified:**
- [Habitat3DDebug.vue](../../src/components/debug/environment/Habitat3DDebug.vue) - Updated `handleCanvasClick()` to check all intersections for poop

---

### Remove Water Bottle Rotation Debug Panel
**Priority:** MEDIUM (P2)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Category:** Cleanup

**Goal:** Remove the Water Bottle Rotation Debug panel - feature is now stable

**Files Modified:**
- [Habitat3DDebug.vue](../../src/components/debug/environment/Habitat3DDebug.vue) - Removed rotation debug panel, CSS, and related functions

---

### Remove Floating Action Buttons
**Priority:** HIGH (P1)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Category:** Refactor

**Goal:** Remove the current floating action buttons (Feed, Water, Play, Pet, Deselect) that appear when clicking a guinea pig

**Files Modified:**
- [Habitat3DDebug.vue](../../src/components/debug/environment/Habitat3DDebug.vue) - Removed FAB components, replaced with GuineaPigInfoMenu

---

### Create Guinea Pig Info Menu Component
**Priority:** HIGH (P1)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Category:** New Feature

**Goal:** Create a menu that appears when clicking a guinea pig showing info and controls

**Implementation:**
- Created [GuineaPigInfoMenu.vue](../../src/components/game/GuineaPigInfoMenu.vue)
- Displays: Name, breed, gender, age
- Shows all 8 needs as color-coded progress bars (green/yellow/red based on value)
- Positioned near clicked guinea pig
- "Take Control" button (placeholder for next sprint item)
- Close button to deselect

**Files Created:**
- [GuineaPigInfoMenu.vue](../../src/components/game/GuineaPigInfoMenu.vue) - New component

**Files Modified:**
- [Habitat3DDebug.vue](../../src/components/debug/environment/Habitat3DDebug.vue) - Integrated new menu, click handling

---

### Implement "Take Control" Mode
**Priority:** HIGH (P1)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Category:** New Feature

**Goal:** Allow player to manually control guinea pig movement by clicking destinations

**Behavior:**
1. Click "Take Control" button in guinea pig menu
2. Guinea pig gets different colored selection ring (blue instead of green)
3. Click anywhere in habitat to set walk destination
4. Guinea pig walks to clicked point using existing pathfinding (obstacle avoidance)
5. Control auto-releases after 30 seconds (like 2D view)
6. Menu can be closed while still in control mode
7. Clicking another guinea pig or pressing escape releases control

**Implementation:**
- Added `controlledGuineaPigId` ref to track which guinea pig is being controlled
- Modified `handleCanvasClick` to detect control mode and set walk destination
- Uses `use3DMovement.moveTo()` for pathfinding
- Added 30-second auto-release timer
- Selection ring changes from green (0x00ff00) to blue (0x0088ff) when controlling
- Pauses autonomous hunger behavior while controlling, resumes on release

**Files Modified:**
- [Habitat3DDebug.vue](../../src/components/debug/environment/Habitat3DDebug.vue) - Control mode logic, click handling
- [GuineaPigInfoMenu.vue](../../src/components/game/GuineaPigInfoMenu.vue) - Take Control button with emit

---

### Add Guinea Pig Selection Toggle
**Priority:** MEDIUM (P2)
**Status:** ⏸️ DEFERRED
**Category:** UI Enhancement

**Goal:** Add guinea pig selection toggle button (reuse from 2D HabitatDebug)

**Reason Deferred:** Debug-only feature, not needed for final game. Testing via click selection in 3D view.

---

### Add Manual Triggers Panel
**Priority:** MEDIUM (P2)
**Status:** ⏸️ DEFERRED
**Category:** Debug Feature

**Goal:** Add debug panel with manual behavior triggers

**Reason Deferred:** Debug-only feature, not needed for final game.

---

### Add Needs Panel
**Priority:** MEDIUM (P2)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Category:** Debug Feature

**Goal:** Add debug panel for viewing/editing guinea pig needs

**Implementation:**
- Reused existing `NeedsPanel.vue` component from 2D view
- Added below 3D canvas with conditional rendering
- Same functionality: view/edit all needs, toggle guinea pigs, replenish all button

**Files Modified:**
- [Habitat3DDebug.vue](../../src/components/debug/environment/Habitat3DDebug.vue) - Import and add NeedsPanel

---

### Add Colors to Guinea Pig Model
**Priority:** LOW (P3)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Category:** UX Polish

**Goal:** Add color variations to the 3D guinea pig model

**Implementation:**
- Created `GuineaPig3DColors` type and `getGuineaPig3DColors()` mapping function
- Maps fur color names (brown, cream, black, etc.) to hex values for fur, ear, skin, eye
- `createGuineaPigModel()` accepts optional colors parameter
- `use3DSync` passes guinea pig appearance colors when creating models

**Files Modified:**
- [guineaPigColors.ts](../../src/constants/guineaPigColors.ts) - Color mapping constants
- [use3DGuineaPig.ts](../../src/composables/use3DGuineaPig.ts) - Accept color parameter
- [use3DSync.ts](../../src/composables/use3DSync.ts) - Pass colors from guinea pig appearance

---

### Create Fur Patterns
**Priority:** LOW (P3)
**Status:** ⏸️ DEFERRED
**Category:** UX Polish

**Goal:** Add fur pattern variations to guinea pig models

**Reason Deferred:** Complex texture work, colors sufficient for MVP.

---

### Implement Drink Action (Thirst Behavior)
**Priority:** HIGH (P1)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Category:** Core Feature

**Goal:** Guinea pigs autonomously drink water when thirsty, with visual feedback

**Behavior:**
1. Replicate thirst need values/thresholds from 2D version
2. When thirst drops below threshold, guinea pig navigates to water bottle
3. Guinea pig drinks water (animation at bottle)
4. Water level decreases visually in bottle
5. Animated bubbles appear in bottle while drinking
6. Click water bottle to show menu:
   - Display current water level value
   - "Refill Water Bottle" button

**Implementation:**
- Thirst threshold = 65 (seek water when < 65), drinking duration = 3000ms, restore amount = 35%
- Updated water bottle 3D model to show dynamic water level (scales based on habitatConditions.waterLevel)
- Added bubble particle effect during drinking (8 bubbles with wobble animation)
- Created `WaterBottleMenu.vue` component with water level display and refill button
- Wired up click detection in `Habitat3DDebug.vue`
- **Note:** Initially created as separate `use3DThirstBehavior.ts`, later refactored into unified system (see below)

**Files Created:**
- [WaterBottleMenu.vue](../../src/components/game/WaterBottleMenu.vue) - Water bottle interaction menu

**Files Modified:**
- [Habitat3DDebug.vue](../../src/components/debug/environment/Habitat3DDebug.vue) - Add thirst behavior, water bottle click, bubble updates
- [water-bottles.ts](../../src/composables/3d-models/containers/water-bottles.ts) - Dynamic water level, bubble animation functions

---

### Unified 3D Behavior System
**Priority:** HIGH (P1)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Category:** Architecture Refactor

**Problem:** Separate behavior composables (`use3DHungerBehavior.ts`, `use3DThirstBehavior.ts`) each created their own movement controller, causing conflicts when both tried to control the same guinea pig.

**Solution:** Created unified `use3DBehavior.ts` following the 2D pattern from `useGuineaPigBehavior.ts`:
- Single behavior controller per guinea pig
- Single movement controller shared across all behaviors
- Priority-based goal selection (higher urgency = higher priority)
- Cooldown system to prevent behavior spamming
- Extensible for future needs (sleep, groom, play, etc.)

**Thresholds:**
| Need | Threshold | Duration | Restore |
|------|-----------|----------|---------|
| Hunger | 70 | 3000ms | 50 |
| Thirst | 65 | 3000ms | 35 |

**Files Created:**
- [use3DBehavior.ts](../../src/composables/3d/use3DBehavior.ts) - Unified behavior controller
- [2-unified-3d-behavior-system.md](./2-unified-3d-behavior-system.md) - Design document

**Files Modified:**
- [Habitat3DDebug.vue](../../src/components/debug/environment/Habitat3DDebug.vue) - Use unified behavior

**Files Deleted:**
- `use3DHungerBehavior.ts` - Replaced by unified system
- `use3DThirstBehavior.ts` - Replaced by unified system

---

### Guinea Pig Breathing Animation
**Priority:** LOW (P3)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Category:** Animation Polish

**Goal:** Add subtle breathing animation to guinea pig for lifelike appearance

**Implementation:**
- Added breathing animation to `updateGuineaPigAnimation()` function
- 0.5% scale variation on Y-axis only (matches demo reference)
- Slow breathing cycle (`BREATH_SPEED = 1.5`)
- Random start phase per guinea pig for variety
- Freezes when game is paused

**Files Modified:**
- [use3DGuineaPig.ts](../../src/composables/use3DGuineaPig.ts) - Added breathing animation constants and logic

---

### Animation Pause on Game Pause
**Priority:** MEDIUM (P2)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Category:** Bug Fix / Polish

**Goal:** Freeze all guinea pig animations when game is paused

**Implementation:**
- Added `isPaused` parameter to `updateGuineaPigAnimation()` function
- When paused, all animations freeze completely (breathing, blinking, foot movement)
- Animations resume naturally when game unpauses
- Uses `gameController.isPaused` from store

**Files Modified:**
- [use3DGuineaPig.ts](../../src/composables/use3DGuineaPig.ts) - Added isPaused parameter and early return
- [Habitat3DDebug.vue](../../src/components/debug/environment/Habitat3DDebug.vue) - Pass gameController.isPaused to animation function

---

### Fix Need Color Consistency
**Priority:** MEDIUM (P2)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Category:** Bug Fix

**Issue:** GuineaPigInfoMenu used different thresholds (>=70 green) than NeedRow (>=60 green), causing color mismatch between the info menu and needs panel.

**Solution:** Updated GuineaPigInfoMenu to use same thresholds as NeedRow:
- Green (satisfied): >= 60
- Grey (good): 40-59
- Yellow (medium): 30-39
- Red (critical): < 30

**Files Modified:**
- [GuineaPigInfoMenu.vue](../../src/components/game/GuineaPigInfoMenu.vue) - Updated `getNeedColorClass()` thresholds, added "good" grey state

---

### Update Red Guinea Pig Color
**Priority:** LOW (P3)
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Category:** Visual Polish

**Goal:** Adjust the red/ginger guinea pig fur color to look more natural

**Change:** Updated red guinea pig color from default to `0xdb3a00` (bright rust/ginger)

**Files Modified:**
- [guineaPigColors.ts](../../src/constants/guineaPigColors.ts) - Updated red color preset

## Next Session TODO

### Testing
- [ ] Test drinking behavior end-to-end (thirst < 65 triggers seek water)
- [ ] Test hunger fulfillment end-to-end (hunger < 70 triggers seek food)
- [ ] Verify water level decreases when drinking
- [ ] Verify bubble animation appears during drinking
- [ ] Verify needs restore correctly after eating/drinking

### Code Quality
- [ ] Run code audit on new 3D behavior system
- [ ] Run CSS audit on new components (GuineaPigInfoMenu, WaterBottleMenu)
- [ ] Fix any issues found in audits

### Next Feature: Shelter Need Fulfillment
**Goal:** Guinea pig enters igloo when shelter need is low

**Implementation Steps:**
1. [ ] Allow guinea pig to pathfind INTO the igloo (currently blocked?)
2. [ ] Add shelter threshold to `use3DBehavior.ts` (threshold ~60)
3. [ ] Add `seek_shelter` behavior type
4. [ ] Guinea pig navigates to igloo position
5. [ ] Guinea pig "enters" igloo (position inside, maybe scale down or hide?)
6. [ ] Shelter need restores while inside igloo
7. [ ] Guinea pig exits after shelter is satisfied or higher priority need appears

**Design Questions:**
- Should guinea pig be visible inside igloo or hidden?
- How long should guinea pig stay inside?
- Should guinea pig be able to sleep inside (energy need)?

### Future Needs (After Shelter)
