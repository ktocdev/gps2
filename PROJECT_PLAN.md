# Guinea Pig Simulation Game - Framework Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure
1. **Game Controller Store (Pinia)**
   - Game state (intro, playing, paused, stopped)
   - **Enhanced Pause System:**
     - User manual pause/resume controls
     - Automatic orientation-based pause (when OrientationModal is active)
     - Pause state priority (manual pause takes precedence)
     - Preserve user intent across orientation changes
   - Save/load game functionality with browser persistence
   - New game functionality with data reset
   - Auto-save and auto-load on browser open
   - Settings management foundation (expandable structure for all game preferences)
   - **Initial Settings (Phase 1.1):**
     - **Auto-save enabled/disabled** (default: enabled)
     - **Save frequency** (30 seconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes)
     - **Tutorial Controls** (global user preferences that persist across games):
       - Tutorial mode: 'auto' | 'always_show' | 'never_show' (default: 'auto')
       - Global first-time user detection
       - Manual override controls for tutorial display
     - **Performance mode** (standard/reduced for older devices)
     - **Error reporting enabled/disabled** (default: enabled in development, disabled in production)

## Wellness Rating System - Strategic Design:

**Core Mechanics:**
- **Balanced Care Requirement:** Players must maintain all 7 needs rather than neglecting some for others
- **Consequence Feedback Loop:** Poor overall care damages the guinea pig relationship through wellness penalties
- **Progressive Difficulty:** As friendship decreases, interactions become less effective, creating a downward spiral if neglect continues
- **Recovery Opportunity:** Players can recover by improving overall wellness to stop penalties and rebuild friendship through positive interactions

**Mathematical Foundation:**
- Wellness = Average of all needs (hunger, thirst, happiness, cleanliness, health, energy, social) - **calculated internally**
- Penalty Threshold: Wellness < 45% triggers friendship loss
- Penalty Rate: -0.5 to -1 friendship per game tick (adjustable for game balance)
- **Player Feedback:** Contextual warnings when wellness < 50%, friendship meter shows penalty effects with trend indicators

**Gameplay Impact:**
- **Strategic Depth:** Forces holistic pet care approach rather than selective attention
- **Discovery-Based Learning:** Players learn balanced care through friendship changes and contextual hints
- **Emotional Investment:** Relationship damage creates genuine concern and motivation to improve care
- **Skill Development:** Players develop intuition about guinea pig care through observation and feedback
- **Realistic Simulation:** More natural pet relationship without artificial wellness meters
- **Long-term Engagement:** Relationship recovery provides meaningful progression goals

## Habitat Conditions System - Environmental Management:

**Core Habitat Conditions (separate from guinea pig needs):**
- **Cleanliness Level (0-100):** Decreases as poops accumulate in cage, restored by cleaning cage
- **Bedding Freshness (0-100):** Gradually decays over time, refreshed by consuming bedding resource
- **Water Level (0-100):** Decreases when guinea pig drinks, refilled for free via "Refresh Water"

**Resource Management:**
- **Bedding as Consumable:** Players must purchase bedding from store, various types with different costs/duration
- **Starter Supply:** New players begin with initial bedding inventory to avoid immediate resource pressure
- **Water as Infinite Resource:** No cost to refill water bottle, encourages proper hydration care
- **Strategic Budgeting:** Players must balance bedding costs against other purchases (toys, treats, decorations)

**Environmental Impact on Guinea Pig:**
- **Habitat-to-Needs Integration:** Poor habitat conditions negatively affect specific guinea pig needs
- **Cleanliness Impact:** Low cage cleanliness affects guinea pig's cleanliness need satisfaction
- **Bedding Impact:** Stale bedding reduces guinea pig happiness and comfort
- **Water Impact:** Empty water bottle prevents guinea pig from satisfying thirst need
- **Compound Effect:** Multiple poor habitat conditions can significantly impact wellness rating

**Maintenance Gameplay Loop:**
- **Proactive Care:** Players must anticipate and prevent habitat deterioration
- **Resource Planning:** Managing bedding inventory requires foresight and budgeting
- **Multi-System Balance:** Habitat maintenance adds complexity beyond direct guinea pig interactions
- **Visual Feedback:** Color-coded habitat status indicators help players prioritize maintenance tasks

## Happiness Need System - Entertainment & Enrichment:

- **Medium Impact (+10-15):** Training, bonding activities, environmental changes
- **Low Impact (+5-10):** Basic communication, familiar toy usage, routine comfort

**Item Effectiveness System:**
- **Newness Bonus:** Recently introduced items provide maximum effectiveness
- **Familiarity Decay:** Items become less effective over time (70% → 50% → 30% effectiveness)
- **Rotation Recovery:** Storing and re-introducing items restores some effectiveness
- **Combination Synergy:** Certain item pairings create happiness multipliers

**Environmental Happiness Factors:**
- **Cleanliness Impact:** Dirty cage reduces maximum happiness potential (-20% at very dirty)
- **Bedding Quality:** Fresh bedding maintains baseline happiness, stale bedding accelerates decay
- **Enrichment Density:** More variety in cage setup provides higher baseline happiness
- **Seasonal Elements:** Holiday/themed decorations provide temporary happiness boosts

**Strategic Gameplay Elements:**
- **Budget Management:** Players balance spending on happiness items vs necessities
