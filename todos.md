New
- i am not seeing nails need in the needs section
- we should be able to hand feed treats as well as place in habitat or bowl
- thirst is going down a too fast. guinea pig has trouble keeping up
- bond-progress__bar does not increase as bond increase for both user and guinea pig mate. we should be using the slider component here
- in the hand feed dialog, we should select the food and then click a confirm "Feed" button to feed it actually

- cannot have duplicates of habitat items in habitat. if there is already an item in the habitat, disable the duplicate in the inventory sidebar and add an explanation tooltip. this is already happening for if you try two of the same type of chews or toyss
- can we prevent the emojis from being accidentally highlight/selected when trying to drag and drop
- add special effects when special treats are consumed. when eats the pumpki spice treat, the guinea glows orange for a few seconds. when eating the island treat, the guinea turns into a 🐠 for a few seconds. rainbow treat makes the guinea pig glow a rainbow transition
