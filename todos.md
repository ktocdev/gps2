# To Dos

Guinea Pig Sidebar Panel Tab
- Guinea Pig info tab is inside Inventory3DPanel, should be in its own file
- we should show number of Interactions between guinea pigs in the Guinea Pig sidebar panel tab

Personality Debug Panel
- add the Need Decay Rate Modifiers to the Guinea Pig debug panel below the 3d game view canvas, like in the Guinea Pigs debug page

Guinea Pig Popover
- make the "Take Control" button an icon-only button with title
- add "Pet" and "Hand Feed" icon only buttons that will evoke the U2P social action on that guinea pig
- these buttons should all be smaller and inline beneath the needs
