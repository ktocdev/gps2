New To Dos:

- when we hover on the bedding item in the inventory sidebar, we should see the no-drop cursor

- the responsive table view in supplies store doesn't look that nice. we should plan a better, more efficient responsive layout for the table rows... the responsive grid view looks fine so maybe we should just use that 
- when the sidebar switches to go under the habitat visual, the sub-tab-container should also go beneath the habitat visual, and above the sidebar content
