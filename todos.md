TO DOs
 
- activity feed not showing any logs except pause and resume messages
- change inventory sidebar button to something more generic because this button opens the main sidebars of the game (inventory, guinea pig info, etc)
- the Guinea Pigs game-fab will become the User to Guinea Pig actions. it should have a cuter name and the icon should represent interactions
- the sub game fabs will be the same as the user to guinea pig actions in the 2d game

Keyboard Shortcuts
- shortcut for pause play
- can you suggest ways to optimize the camera control keyboard shortcuts
- sometimes i feel like dragging linearly should move me forward, sometimes i feel like it should rotate the view
    - maybe we can add shift to make more camera view options?

3D Game View
- on page load, the camera should have a clear centered view of the entire habitat
- when not in fullscreen, also show the pause button next to the Enter Fullscreen button in habitat-3d-debug__normal-header
    - change the classname habitat-3d-debug__normal-header to game-view__header

Enhanced Habitat Physics
- add physics to habitat items like in 3d demo
- clicking stick, ball will make them roll naturally
- guinea pig can push the stick and ball, and other appropriate items

3D Models
- create 3d models for other food items
- enhance hay 3d model
- create 3d models for some other habitat items
- guinea pigs autonomously walk through the arch tunnel, igloo walls, water bottle
- guiniea pig waters through water bottle when drinking

Multiple Item Instances
- test adding multiple:
    - food containers
    - water bottles
    - toys, etc

Chat Bubble
- add guinea pig chat bubbles for reactions, etc - parity from 2d game
- would 3d chat bubbles look cute? flat 3d?

Autonomous Actions 
- finish out autonomous need fulfillment methods
    - play, chew, socialize - parity with 2d game

Expand Guinea Pig to Guinea Pig actions (GP2GP)
- guinea pig to guinea pig actions (social, play, groom, greet, check out) - parity with 2d game

- replace comfort need with stimulation
    - this is documented in the docs folder somewhere
