# Guinea Pig Bonding & Compatibility System

**Phase 4, System 17+ - Interactions & Behaviors**

## Overview

Create a realistic guinea pig bonding system that affects social interactions, happiness, and resource efficiency based on real guinea pig research and behavioral studies. **Compatibility is completely hidden** with natural discovery through gameplay to encourage authentic pet adoption experiences.

## Core System Philosophy

The bonding system prioritizes **natural relationship development** over optimization mechanics:
- No visible compatibility scores during selection
- Personality hints provide subtle guidance without revealing mechanics
- Bonding develops through positive interactions and time spent together
- All guinea pig pairs can eventually bond, with varying speeds based on hidden compatibility
- Focus on care and relationship building rather than min-maxing

## Current System Integration

### Existing Foundation
- **Gender:** Male/Female
- **Breed:** 13 breeds with rarity system (common to ultra-rare)
- **Personality:** 4 traits (friendliness, playfulness, curiosity, independence) on 1-10 scale
- **2 Guinea Pig Limit:** Current system supports up to 2 active guinea pigs
- **Social Need System:** Existing social need decay and satisfaction mechanics

## Bonding Level System

### Three Bonding Tiers (Hidden from Player)

#### ü§ù Neutral (0-30%)
**Status:** Guinea pigs tolerate each other
- Standard social need satisfaction rates
- Normal interaction frequency baseline
- Basic companionship benefits (20% slower social decay)
- No special bonuses or penalties

#### üòä Friends (31-70%)
**Status:** Guinea pigs enjoy each other's company
- **Enhanced Social Satisfaction:** 15% bonus to social need satisfaction from interactions
- **Increased Interactions:** 20% higher interaction frequency
- **Proximity Bonus:** Small happiness bonus when near each other (25% bonus)
- **Activity Feed:** Friendship milestone messages appear

#### üíï Bonded (71-100%)
**Status:** Deep partnership bond established
- **Significant Social Satisfaction:** 30% bonus to social need satisfaction from interactions
- **High Interaction Frequency:** 40% increase in interaction frequency
- **Strong Proximity Bonus:** Significant happiness bonus when together (40% bonus)
- **Synchronized Behaviors:** More likely to perform activities together
- **Activity Feed:** Bonding milestone messages and special interaction descriptions

## Hidden Compatibility Calculation

### Research-Based Compatibility Factors

#### Gender Compatibility
Based on real guinea pig social research:

**Male-Female Pairs:** +25 compatibility points
- Research shows mixed pairings work very well with less competitive dynamics
- Strongest bonding potential (real guinea pigs form specific male-female partnerships)
- Natural complementary behaviors

**Female-Female Pairs:** +15 compatibility points
- Research indicates females tend to get on very well together
- Easier to introduce and maintain stable relationships
- Less territorial behavior

**Male-Male Pairs:** +5 compatibility points
- Recent research shows males can form stable pairs when no females present
- Requires more time and careful introduction but achievable
- Possible with proper space and resources

#### Personality Compatibility Matrix

**Friendliness Interactions:**
- **High + High (7-10 + 7-10):** +20 points (both outgoing, natural social connection)
- **High + Low (7-10 + 1-3):** +10 points (complementary - outgoing helps shy guinea pig)
- **Medium + Any (4-6 + any):** +5 points (flexible personality adapts well)
- **Low + Low (1-3 + 1-3):** -5 points (both too shy to initiate bonding)

**Independence Balance:**
- **Balanced Independence (both 4-7):** +15 points (good balance of togetherness and space)
- **Complementary Independence (one high, one low):** +5 points (can work with adjustment)
- **Extreme Mismatch (8-10 with 1-3):** -10 points (very independent with very dependent)

**Playfulness Compatibility:**
- **Similar Playfulness (within 3 points):** +10 points (shared activity preferences)
- **Complementary Energy (high + medium):** +5 points (can balance each other)
- **Extreme Mismatch (9-10 with 1-2):** -5 points (very different activity needs)

**Curiosity Alignment:**
- **Both High Curiosity (7-10):** +10 points (explore together)
- **Mixed Curiosity:** +5 points (curious one leads, other follows)
- **Both Low Curiosity:** +0 points (content but less dynamic bonding)

#### Breed Compatibility

**Same Breed:** +10 points
- Familiar behaviors and characteristics
- Similar grooming needs and activity patterns
- Natural understanding of breed-specific behaviors

**Similar Breed Families:** +5 points
- **Long-haired breeds:** Peruvian, Silkie, Texel, Coronet, Alpaca
- **Short-haired breeds:** American, Abyssinian, Teddy, Rex
- **Hairless breeds:** Baldwin, Skinny Pig
- **Active breeds:** Abyssinian, Rex, Teddy
- **Calm breeds:** American, Peruvian, Silkie

**Different Breed Families:** +0 points
- No bonus or penalty for different breed types
- Compatibility depends more on personality than breed

### Compatibility Score Calculation

```typescript
function calculateCompatibility(guineaPig1: GuineaPig, guineaPig2: GuineaPig): number {
  let compatibilityScore = 0

  // Gender compatibility
  if (guineaPig1.gender !== guineaPig2.gender) {
    compatibilityScore += 25 // Male-Female
  } else if (guineaPig1.gender === 'female') {
    compatibilityScore += 15 // Female-Female
  } else {
    compatibilityScore += 5  // Male-Male
  }

  // Personality compatibility
  compatibilityScore += calculatePersonalityCompatibility(
    guineaPig1.personality,
    guineaPig2.personality
  )

  // Breed compatibility
  if (guineaPig1.breed === guineaPig2.breed) {
    compatibilityScore += 10
  } else if (isSimilarBreedFamily(guineaPig1.breed, guineaPig2.breed)) {
    compatibilityScore += 5
  }

  // Ensure score stays within bounds
  return Math.max(0, Math.min(100, compatibilityScore))
}
```

## Pet Store Selection Enhancement

### Personality Hint System

When players click on a guinea pig during selection, they see **one random hint** from that guinea pig's available hints. This provides subtle personality guidance without revealing compatibility mechanics.

#### Hint Categories by Personality Trait

**Friendliness Hints:**

*High Friendliness (7-10):*
- *"[Name] seems very interested in meeting you"*
- *"[Name] appears comfortable around others"*
- *"[Name] watches the other guinea pigs with curiosity"*

*Medium Friendliness (4-6):*
- *"[Name] is warming up to your presence"*
- *"[Name] seems cautiously optimistic about new friends"*
- *"[Name] observes others with quiet interest"*

*Low Friendliness (1-3):*
- *"[Name] seems a bit shy and stays in the corner"*
- *"[Name] prefers observing from a distance"*
- *"[Name] is quite reserved but alert"*

**Playfulness Hints:**

*High Playfulness (7-10):*
- *"[Name] bounces around when excited"*
- *"[Name] seems eager for some fun"*
- *"[Name] investigates every new thing with enthusiasm"*

*Medium Playfulness (4-6):*
- *"[Name] enjoys both active play and quiet time"*
- *"[Name] shows interest in activities at their own pace"*
- *"[Name] has a balanced approach to fun and rest"*

*Low Playfulness (1-3):*
- *"[Name] prefers calm, peaceful moments"*
- *"[Name] enjoys quiet contemplation"*
- *"[Name] has a gentle, laid-back nature"*

**Independence Hints:**

*High Independence (7-10):*
- *"[Name] confidently explores on their own"*
- *"[Name] seems quite self-sufficient"*
- *"[Name] does their own thing with confidence"*

*Medium Independence (4-6):*
- *"[Name] enjoys both independence and companionship"*
- *"[Name] seems adaptable to different situations"*

- *"[Name] sniffs and explores constantly"*
- *"[Name] seems fascinated by new sights and sounds"*

*Medium Curiosity (4-6):*
- *"[Name] shows selective interest in their surroundings"*
- *"[Name] explores at a thoughtful pace"*
- *"[Name] is observant in their own way"*

*Low Curiosity (1-3):*
- *"[Name] sticks to familiar routines"*
- *"[Name] prefers known comforts"*
- *"[Name] is content with simple pleasures"*

### Hint Rotation Mechanics

**Per Guinea Pig:**
- Each guinea pig has exactly **3 hints** selected based on their personality traits
- Hints chosen from most prominent personality traits (highest scores)
- Clicking shows a random hint from their available set
- Players can discover all hints by clicking multiple times
- No explicit indication of how many hints exist (natural discovery)

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
interface GuineaPigHints {
  personalityHints: string[]  // 3 hints per guinea pig
  usedHints: string[]        // Track which hints have been shown
  currentHintIndex: number   // For rotation tracking
}

function getRandomHint(guineaPigId: string): string {
  const guinea_pig = getGuineaPig(guineaPigId)
  const availableHints = guinea_pig.hints.personalityHints
  const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * availableHints.length)
  return availableHints[randomIndex]
}
```

## Bonding Progression System

### Positive-Only Progression

The bonding system focuses on **positive reinforcement** - bonding levels only increase through good experiences, never decrease through negative interactions.

#### Bonding Increase Factors

**Social Interactions:** +2-5 points each
- Grooming interactions: +5 points
- Playing together: +4 points
- Sharing food: +3 points
- Sleeping together: +3 points
- Exploring together: +2 points

**Proximity Time:** +1 point per hour
- Guinea pigs positioned near each other
- Passive bonding through shared space
- Accumulates during active gameplay

**Shared Positive Experiences:** +3-7 points
- Both guinea pigs eating preferred food together: +7 points
- Both guinea pigs playing with favorite toys: +5 points
- Both guinea pigs in good health simultaneously: +3 points

**Wellness Bonus:** +1 point per day
- Both guinea pigs maintaining good wellness (above 70%)
- Rewards consistent care and maintenance
- Long-term relationship building

### Bonding Progression Formula

```typescript
function processBondingProgression(bond: GuineaPigBond): void {
  const gp1 = getGuineaPig(bond.guineaPig1Id)
  const gp2 = getGuineaPig(bond.guineaPig2Id)

  let bonding_increase = 0

  // Check for recent interactions
  const recentInteractions = getRecentSocialInteractions(bond, 24) // Last 24 hours
  bonding_increase += recentInteractions * 3

  // Check proximity time
  const proximityHours = calculateProximityTime(bond, 24)
  bonding_increase += proximityHours * 1

  // Wellness bonus
  if (gp1.wellness > 70 && gp2.wellness > 70) {
    bonding_increase += 1
  }

  // Apply compatibility modifier
  const compatibilityMultiplier = bond.compatibilityScore / 100
  bonding_increase *= compatibilityMultiplier

  // Update bonding level
  bond.bondingLevel = Math.min(100, bond.bondingLevel + bonding_increase)

  // Check for tier advancement
  updateBondingTier(bond)
}
```

## Social Need Processing Enhancement

### Bonding-Based Social Need Modifiers

The existing social need system is enhanced with bonding-level modifiers that provide increasingly better social need satisfaction as guinea pigs bond.

```typescript
function processEnhancedSocialNeed(guineaPigId: string, deltaTime: number): void {
  const guineaPig = getGuineaPig(guineaPigId)
  const bond = getActiveBond(guineaPigId)

  let socialDecayRate = baseSocialDecayRate
  let proximityBonus = 0

  if (bond) {
    // Apply bonding level modifiers
    if (bond.bondingLevel >= 71) {        // Bonded
      socialDecayRate *= 0.5  // 50% slower decay
      proximityBonus = 0.4    // 40% bonus when near
    } else if (bond.bondingLevel >= 31) { // Friends
      socialDecayRate *= 0.7  // 30% slower decay
      proximityBonus = 0.25   // 25% bonus when near
    } else {                             // Neutral
      socialDecayRate *= 0.8  // 20% slower decay (basic companionship)
      proximityBonus = 0.1    // 10% bonus when near
    }

    // Apply proximity bonus if guinea pigs are near each other
    if (areGuineaPigsNearEachOther(bond.guineaPig1Id, bond.guineaPig2Id)) {
      const proximityBenefit = proximityBonus * baseSocialSatisfaction
      satisfyNeed(guineaPigId, 'social', proximityBenefit)
    }
  } else {
    // Single guinea pig - faster social decay
    socialDecayRate *= 1.3 // 30% faster decay when alone
  }

  // Apply enhanced social decay processing
  const decayAmount = socialDecayRate * (deltaTime / (1000 * 60 * 60))
  adjustNeed(guineaPigId, 'social', decayAmount)
}
```

## Natural Bonding Discovery

### Player Discovery Methods

Players learn about bonding relationships through natural gameplay observation rather than explicit UI elements:

#### Activity Feed Messages

**Bonding Milestone Messages:**
- Neutral ‚Üí Friends: *"[Name1] and [Name2] seem to be getting along well"*
- Friends ‚Üí Bonded: *"[Name1] and [Name2] have become close friends"*
- Bonded Level: *"[Name1] and [Name2] have formed a strong bond"*

**Enhanced Interaction Messages:**
- *"[Name1] gently grooms [Name2] who seems very content"*
- *"[Name1] and [Name2] explore the habitat together, staying close"*
- *"[Name1] shares their favorite spot with [Name2]"*
- *"[Name1] and [Name2] munch happily side by side"*

#### Behavioral Indicators

**Increased Interaction Frequency:**
- Players notice more frequent social interactions
- Synchronized activities become more common
- Guinea pigs position themselves near each other more often

**Gameplay Benefits:**
- Improved social need satisfaction becomes apparent
- Less frequent social need warnings in activity feed
- Overall guinea pig happiness and wellness improvements

**Visual Cues (Future Enhancement):**
- Guinea pigs positioned closer together in habitat
- Synchronized animations and movements
- Shared activity behaviors

// Add to guinea pig store
const activeBonds = ref<Map<string, GuineaPigBond>>(new Map())

function createBond(guineaPig1Id: string, guineaPig2Id: string): GuineaPigBond {
  const gp1 = getGuineaPig(guineaPig1Id)
  const gp2 = getGuineaPig(guineaPig2Id)

  const bond: GuineaPigBond = {
    id: generateBondId(),
    guineaPig1Id,
    guineaPig2Id,
    bondingLevel: 0,
    bondingTier: 'neutral',

  }

  activeBonds.value.set(bond.id, bond)
  return bond
}

function getActiveBond(guineaPigId: string): GuineaPigBond | null {
  for (const bond of activeBonds.value.values()) {
    if (bond.guineaPig1Id === guineaPigId || bond.guineaPig2Id === guineaPigId) {
      return bond
    }
  }
  return null
}
```

#### Pet Store Manager Enhancements
```typescript
// Add hint generation to pet store manager
function generatePersonalityHints(guineaPig: GuineaPig): string[] {
  const hints: string[] = []
  const personality = guineaPig.personality

  // Get top 3 personality traits
  const traits = [
    { name: 'friendliness', score: personality.friendliness },
    { name: 'playfulness', score: personality.playfulness },
    { name: 'curiosity', score: personality.curiosity },
    { name: 'independence', score: personality.independence }
  ].sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score).slice(0, 3)

  // Generate hints for top traits
  traits.forEach(trait => {
    const hintTemplate = getHintTemplate(trait.name, getScoreRange(trait.score))
    const randomHint = getRandomHint(hintTemplate, guineaPig.name)
    hints.push(randomHint)
  })

  return hints
}
```
