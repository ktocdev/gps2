## Advanced Interaction Mechanics

### Clip Nails - Complex Success System

#### Success Rate Calculation
```typescript
successRate = 0.4 + (friendship * 0.003) + (wellness * 0.002)
baseSuccess = Math.min(successRate, 0.95) // Maximum 95% success rate
```

#### Outcome Categories
- **Complete Success (70%+ rate):** All nails trimmed, full need satisfaction (+40-50 points)
- **Partial Success (40-69% rate):** Some nails trimmed, moderate satisfaction (+20-30 points)
- **Minimal Success (20-39% rate):** Few nails trimmed, small improvement (+10-15 points)
- **Failure (< 20% rate):** No nails trimmed, possible stress reaction

#### Friendship/Wellness Dependencies
- **High friendship (80%+):** Guinea pig cooperates willingly, stays calm
- **Medium friendship (50-79%):** Some resistance, requires patience
- **Low friendship (< 50%):** High resistance, frequent movement, stress reactions
- **High wellness (75%+):** Guinea pig feels comfortable, easier handling
- **Low wellness (< 45%):** Guinea pig stressed, more likely to hide or resist

#### Nail Clipping Reactions
- **Positive reactions:** Calm sitting, gentle purring, trusting eye contact
- **Neutral reactions:** Mild fidgeting, occasional movement, watchful behavior
- **Negative reactions:** Hiding, backing away, stress chattering, aggressive posturing
- **Failure reactions:** Running away, angry wheeks, hiding for extended period

#### Activity Feed Messages
- **Complete success:** "You successfully trim all of [name]'s nails. They sit calmly and trust you completely!"
- **Partial success:** "You manage to trim most of [name]'s nails, but they get restless toward the end."
- **Minimal success:** "[Name] only lets you trim a couple nails before becoming too stressed to continue."
- **Failure:** "[Name] is too stressed and won't let you near their paws today. Try again when they're feeling better."

## Preference Discovery System

### Discovery Interactions
Special interactions designed to reveal guinea pig preferences:

#### Share Snack
- **Purpose:** Reveals fruit and vegetable preferences through guinea pig reactions
- **Positive Response:** Popcorn excitement for favorite foods
- **Negative Response:** Turn away or reluctant eating for disliked foods
- **Learning Mechanism:** Players observe reactions to build preference knowledge

#### Offer Treat
- **Purpose:** Different treats show varying levels of excitement/disinterest
- **Positive Response:** Big popcorn jumps and eager eating
- **Negative Response:** Hesitant approach or nose turn-up
- **Preference Scaling:** Intensity of reaction indicates preference strength

#### Try New Food
- **Purpose:** Introducing new hay/vegetables shows clear preference indicators
- **Positive Response:** Happy munching and content sounds
- **Negative Response:** Nose turn-up and avoidance behaviors
- **Discovery Value:** Each new food reveals personality traits

#### Offer Chew Item
- **Purpose:** Reveals chewing preferences through engagement level
- **Positive Response:** Immediate investigation, enthusiastic chewing, possessive behavior
- **Negative Response:** Brief sniff and ignore, or complete avoidance
- **Preference Learning:** Different chew types show varying interest levels

## Reaction-Based Feedback System

### Immediate Visual Response
- **Every interaction triggers appropriate guinea pig reaction**
- **Reaction intensity scales with friendship level and preference match**
- **Visual feedback provides instant player understanding**
- **Reaction variety prevents repetitive responses**

### Activity Feed Integration
- **All interactions generate natural language messages**
- **Player actions described in engaging, conversational tone**
- **Guinea pig responses captured in descriptive text**
- **Preference discovery moments highlighted in feed**

### Preference Learning Mechanics
- **Reactions teach players about individual guinea pig personality**
- **Text descriptions supplement visual reactions**
- **Progressive learning through repeated interactions**
- **Future animation enhancement will amplify learning cues**

### Friendship Indicators
- **Reaction intensity reflects current relationship strength**
- **Higher friendship = more enthusiastic responses**
- **Lower friendship = subdued or negative reactions**
- **Friendship level affects interaction success rates**

interface InteractionEffect {
  needsImpact: {
    hunger?: number;
    thirst?: number;
    happiness: number;
    cleanliness?: number;
    health?: number;
    energy?: number;
    social: number;
  };
  friendshipGain: number;

interface InteractionResult {
  success: boolean;
  reactionType: GuineaPigReaction;
  activityMessage: string;
  needsChanged: string[];
  friendshipChange: number;
  preferenceDiscovered?: PreferenceType;
}
```
