# Debug Menu System - Distributed Implementation

**Phases 2-5: Built Incrementally with Each System**

## Overview
Development-only debug interface providing comprehensive testing and monitoring capabilities for all game systems. Debug panels are built incrementally alongside each system to ensure complete knowledge of actual implementations, with final consolidation into a unified Debug Menu tab in Phase 5.

## Implementation Strategy

### Incremental Development Approach
Debug panels are built alongside each system to ensure complete understanding of actual implementations:

**Phase 2 Debug Panels (Built with Core Systems):**

- **Wellness System Panel:** Wellness calculation breakdown and penalty testing (built with Needs Controller)
- **Preferences Panel:** View/edit guinea pig preferences, test preference discovery (built with Guinea Pig Store)
- **Habitat Panel:** Manipulate habitat conditions (cleanliness, bedding, water) (built with Habitat Conditions)

**Phase 3 Debug Panels (Built with Game World Systems):**
- **Inventory Debug Panel:** Item management, currency manipulation, store testing (built with Inventory System)
- **Item Interaction Panel:** Habitat item placement and interaction testing (built with Habitat Item System)
- **Maintenance Debug Panel:** Hygiene system testing, poop generation, cleanliness controls (built with Maintenance System)

**Phase 4 Debug Panels (Built with Interaction Systems):**
- **Interaction Debug Panel:** Direct interaction testing, reaction triggers, preference discovery (built with Direct Interaction System)
- **AI Behavior Panel:** Autonomy testing, pathfinding visualization, behavior triggers (built with Autonomy System)

**Phase 5 Consolidation:**
- **Unified Debug Menu Tab:** All debug panels integrated into single interface
- **Advanced Features:** Performance monitoring, stress testing, integration validation

### Real-Time Monitoring
