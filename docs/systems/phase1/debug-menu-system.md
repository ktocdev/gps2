# Debug Menu System - System 4

**Phase 1: Foundation & Infrastructure**

## Overview
Development-only debug interface providing comprehensive testing and monitoring capabilities for all game systems during development.

## Debug System Architecture

### Modular Debug Panels
- **Needs System Panel:** Real-time need values, decay rates, and manual adjustment controls
- **Wellness System Panel:** Wellness calculation breakdown and penalty testing
- **Preferences Panel:** View/edit guinea pig preferences, test preference discovery
- **Reactions Panel:** Trigger specific guinea pig reactions for testing
- **Habitat Panel:** Manipulate habitat conditions (cleanliness, bedding, water)
- **Activity Feed Panel:** Message filtering, history viewing, and manual message injection

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **System Status Indicators:** Live monitoring of all game systems
- **Performance Metrics:** Frame rates, memory usage, and bottleneck identification
- **State Visualization:** Current game state, transitions, and pause reasons
- **Data Flow Tracking:** Watch data changes across stores in real-time

### Testing Interfaces
- **Comprehensive Game Mechanics Testing:** End-to-end workflow validation
- **Stress Testing Tools:** Performance testing under extreme conditions
- **Edge Case Simulation:** Test boundary conditions and error scenarios
- **Integration Validation:** Cross-system interaction testing

## Debug Components (from Layout Framework)

### Core Debug Components
- **DebugPanel:** Collapsible debug interface with tabbed sections
- **NeedControl:** Individual need manipulation controls with sliders
- **WellnessDebugger:** Wellness calculation breakdown and penalty testing
- **HabitatDebugger:** Habitat condition manipulation and testing controls
- **LogViewer:** Scrollable log display with filtering capabilities
- **ValueAdjuster:** Debug slider/input for numeric values
- **FeatureToggle:** Enable/disable feature flags for testing

### Monitoring Components
- **ResponsiveDetector:** Service component for viewport monitoring
- **DeviceTypeIndicator:** Debug component showing current device/orientation state
- **PerformanceMonitor:** Real-time performance metrics display
- **StateInspector:** Live game state visualization and editing

## Integration Points

### Component Library Connection
- All debug components defined in Section 2 (Layout & Component Framework)
- **Centralized debug state management** via DebugPanel component
- **Consistent styling** with main game UI but clearly marked as debug-only
- **Responsive design** adapts to different screen sizes during development

### System Integration Hooks
- **Each game system includes debug integration hooks** for manipulation and monitoring
- **Standardized debug interfaces** for consistent debugging experience
- **Hot-swappable debug modules** for focused testing of specific systems
- **Cross-system debugging** capabilities for integration testing

## Development Features

### Access & Security
- **Development builds only:** Completely removed from production builds
- **Keyboard shortcut access:** Toggle visibility with configurable hotkey (default: Ctrl+Shift+D)
- **Permission levels:** Different debug access levels for different team members
- **Safe mode override:** Disable debug features that could corrupt save data

### Data Management
- **Debug data persistence:** Save debug configurations for testing scenarios
- **Export/import capabilities:** Share debug configurations between developers
- **Session recording:** Record debug sessions for bug reproduction
- **Automated testing integration:** Connect with automated test suites

## System Testing Capabilities

### End-to-End Testing
- **Complete game flow validation:** From guinea pig creation to advanced gameplay
- **User journey simulation:** Automated testing of common player paths
- **Edge case coverage:** Test unusual combinations and boundary conditions
- **Regression testing:** Verify fixes don't break existing functionality

### Performance & Stability
- **Performance stress testing:** High-frequency interactions and rapid state changes
- **Memory leak detection:** Long-running sessions with monitoring
- **Data corruption recovery testing:** Simulate save file corruption scenarios
- **Browser compatibility testing:** Cross-browser debugging tools

### Integration Validation
- **Store communication verification:** Monitor data flow between Pinia stores
- **Component lifecycle testing:** Track component mounting/unmounting
- **Event system validation:** Verify proper event propagation and handling
- **API integration testing:** Mock external services and test responses

## Debug Workflow Integration

### Development Process
1. **System Development:** Build with debug hooks from the start
2. **Testing Phase:** Use debug panels to validate functionality
3. **Integration Testing:** Cross-system validation with debug monitoring
4. **Bug Investigation:** Use recorded sessions and state inspection
5. **Performance Optimization:** Identify bottlenecks with monitoring tools

### Team Collaboration
- **Shared debug configurations** for consistent testing environments
- **Bug reproduction tools** for clear issue reporting
- **Development metrics** for tracking system performance over time
- **Knowledge sharing** through debug session recordings

## Future Enhancements
- **Automated test generation** from debug interactions
- **Advanced profiling tools** for deep performance analysis
- **Remote debugging capabilities** for testing on different devices
- **Visual debugging tools** for complex data structures and relationships
