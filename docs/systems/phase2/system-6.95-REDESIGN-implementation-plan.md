# System 6.95 REDESIGN - Implementation Plan

**System:** Permanent Adoption & Stardust Sanctuary Gateway
**Phase:** Phase 2 (Pet Store & Session Management)
**Status:** üìã Planned
**Created:** October 12, 2025
**Updated:** October 13, 2025

---

## Overview

This implementation plan provides a careful, systematic approach to implementing the complete redesign of System 6.95. The redesign transforms the pet store from a temporary selection mechanism with session endings into a permanent adoption system with friendship-gated Stardust Sanctuary progression.

**Key Changes:**
- ‚ùå Remove ALL refresh mechanics (manual + auto)
- ‚ùå Remove session ending system entirely
- ‚úÖ Add permanent adoption (no returns ever)
- ‚úÖ Add friendship-gated Stardust Sanctuary (85% threshold)
- ‚úÖ Add natural store churn (adoption timers)
- ‚úÖ Add pairing validation and bond preservation

**Estimated Timeline:** 5-6 weeks full implementation + testing

**Note:** Phase 7 (Update Safety Net Systems) has been removed from this plan as Guinea Pig Rescue (Phase 2.5 System 4) has not been built yet. Stardust Sanctuary integration requirements have been documented in [system-4-guinea-pig-rescue.md](../phase2.5/system-4-guinea-pig-rescue.md) for future implementation.

## Phase 0: Friendship System Enhancement (PREREQUISITE)

**Duration:** 3-5 days
**Goal:** Implement friendship mechanics required for 85% threshold gating
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### Tasks

- [x] **Add friendship gain from interactions**
  - Pet: +2 friendship (socializeWithGuineaPig)
  - Play: +3 friendship (playWithGuineaPig)
  - Handle: +1 friendship (included in socialize)
  - Groom: +2 friendship (cleanGuineaPig)
  - Feed favorite food: +5 friendship (feedGuineaPig)
  - Feed normal food: +1 friendship (feedGuineaPig)

- [x] **Add interaction cooldowns for play and socialize**
  - Track `lastPlayTime` and `lastSocialTime` on GuineaPig
  - Calculate cooldown based on personality, friendship, and wellness
  - **Personality modifiers:**
    - Friendliness (1-10): Higher = shorter cooldown for social interactions
    - Playfulness (1-10): Higher = shorter cooldown for play interactions
  - **Friendship modifiers:**
    - Low friendship (0-40): Longer cooldowns, more easily overwhelmed
    - Medium friendship (41-70): Standard cooldowns
    - High friendship (71-100): Shorter cooldowns, enjoys player company
  - **Wellness modifiers:**
    - Low wellness (<30%): Much longer cooldowns, needs rest
    - Medium wellness (30-70%): Standard cooldowns
    - High wellness (>70%): Shorter cooldowns, energetic and ready
  - **Cooldown formula example:**
    - Base cooldown: 60 seconds for play, 45 seconds for social
    - Friendly (friendliness 8+) + high friendship (80+) + high wellness (80+) = 30s cooldown
    - Shy (friendliness 3-) + low friendship (30-) + low wellness (30-) = 180s cooldown
  - Block interaction during cooldown with message: "[Name] needs a break. Try again in Xs."
  - Award friendship points only when cooldown complete

- [x] **Add friendship gain from need fulfillment**
  - Calculate based on need amount satisfied
  - Range: +0.5 to +2 friendship per need fulfilled

  - +0.1 friendship per game tick
  - Only when wellness > 50%
  - Encourages consistent care
  - Implemented in `processBatchNeedsDecay()`

  - Display current friendship percentage
  - Show progress bar with 85% goal indicator
  - Show "X% to Stardust Sanctuary!" message when below 85%
  - Integrated as standalone component (ready for main game view)
  - Implemented in `src/components/game/FriendshipProgress.vue`

- [x] **Add friendship loss mechanics**
  - Wellness < 50%: -1 per tick
  - Wellness < 30%: -2 per tick
  - Individual needs < 30%: -0.5 per need per tick (stacks)
  - Implemented in `processBatchNeedsDecay()`

- [x] **Create FriendshipDebug.vue panel**
  - Real-time friendship tracking with progress bar
  - Cooldown status monitoring (play and social)
  - Net change per tick calculator
  - Debug controls for testing (add/subtract friendship, test interactions)
  - Added to Debug View as "Friendship" tab üíñ
  - Implemented in `src/components/debug/FriendshipDebug.vue`

- [ ] **Playtest and tune friendship gain rates** (OPTIONAL - can be done during Phase 2+)
  - Ensure 85% achievable in 3-5 days with good care
  - Excellent care should reach 85% in 2-3 days

### High Risk Areas

1. **Friendship tuning** - May require multiple iterations to get 85% achievable in 3-5 days
2. **Bond preservation** - Complex logic with edge cases (multiple pairings, different partners)
3. **Save data migration** - Must not break existing player data

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Friendship tuning** - Extensive playtesting in Phase 0, adjustable gain rates
2. **Bond preservation** - Comprehensive unit tests, clear test cases
3. **Save data migration** - Grandfather clause, thorough migration testing, rollback plan

### Dependencies

- **Phase 0 must complete first** - All other phases depend on friendship system
- **Phase 1-2 can run in parallel** - Refresh removal and timer addition independent
- **Phase 4 depends on Phase 0** - Friendship gating requires friendship system
- **Phase 5 depends on Phase 4** - Pairing validation uses Sanctuary status
- **Phase 7 depends on Phase 2.5 System 4** - Guinea Pig Rescue must be built first

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues discovered after deployment:

1. **Immediate rollback** - Revert to previous version (System 6.95 v1)
2. **Data preservation** - Ensure no player data lost in rollback
3. **Issue diagnosis** - Identify specific problem area
4. **Targeted fix** - Fix specific phase without full rollback
5. **Re-deploy** - Test thoroughly before re-deploying

**Rollback triggers:**
- Critical bug preventing gameplay
- Data corruption or loss
- Performance degradation
- Major player complaints

## Next Steps

1. **Review this implementation plan** - Ensure all stakeholders agree
2. **Begin Phase 0** - Friendship System Enhancement (prerequisite)
3. **Track progress** - Mark tasks complete in todo list
4. **Regular testing** - Test after each phase completion
5. **Iterate** - Adjust plan based on learnings

**Ready to begin?** Start with Phase 0: Friendship System Enhancement
