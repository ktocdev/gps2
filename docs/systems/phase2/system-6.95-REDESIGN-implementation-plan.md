# System 6.95 REDESIGN - Implementation Plan

**System:** Permanent Adoption & Stardust Sanctuary Gateway
**Phase:** Phase 2 (Pet Store & Session Management)
**Status:** üìã Planned
**Created:** October 12, 2025

---

## Overview

This implementation plan provides a careful, systematic approach to implementing the complete redesign of System 6.95. The redesign transforms the pet store from a temporary selection mechanism with session endings into a permanent adoption system with friendship-gated Stardust Sanctuary progression.

**Key Changes:**
- ‚ùå Remove ALL refresh mechanics (manual + auto)
- ‚ùå Remove session ending system entirely
- ‚úÖ Add permanent adoption (no returns ever)
- ‚úÖ Add friendship-gated Stardust Sanctuary (85% threshold)
- ‚úÖ Add natural store churn (adoption timers)
- ‚úÖ Add pairing validation and bond preservation

**Estimated Timeline:** 5-6 weeks full implementation + testing

---

## Phase 0: Friendship System Enhancement (PREREQUISITE)

**Duration:** 3-5 days
**Goal:** Implement friendship mechanics required for 85% threshold gating
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### Tasks

- [x] **Add friendship gain from interactions**
  - Pet: +2 friendship (socializeWithGuineaPig)
  - Play: +3 friendship (playWithGuineaPig)
  - Handle: +1 friendship (included in socialize)
  - Groom: +2 friendship (cleanGuineaPig)
  - Feed favorite food: +5 friendship (feedGuineaPig)
  - Feed normal food: +1 friendship (feedGuineaPig)

- [x] **Add interaction cooldowns for play and socialize**
  - Track `lastPlayTime` and `lastSocialTime` on GuineaPig
  - Calculate cooldown based on personality, friendship, and wellness
  - **Personality modifiers:**
    - Friendliness (1-10): Higher = shorter cooldown for social interactions
    - Playfulness (1-10): Higher = shorter cooldown for play interactions
  - **Friendship modifiers:**
    - Low friendship (0-40): Longer cooldowns, more easily overwhelmed
    - Medium friendship (41-70): Standard cooldowns
    - High friendship (71-100): Shorter cooldowns, enjoys player company
  - **Wellness modifiers:**
    - Low wellness (<30%): Much longer cooldowns, needs rest
    - Medium wellness (30-70%): Standard cooldowns
    - High wellness (>70%): Shorter cooldowns, energetic and ready
  - **Cooldown formula example:**
    - Base cooldown: 60 seconds for play, 45 seconds for social
    - Friendly (friendliness 8+) + high friendship (80+) + high wellness (80+) = 30s cooldown
    - Shy (friendliness 3-) + low friendship (30-) + low wellness (30-) = 180s cooldown
  - Block interaction during cooldown with message: "[Name] needs a break. Try again in Xs."
  - Award friendship points only when cooldown complete

- [x] **Add friendship gain from need fulfillment**
  - Calculate based on need amount satisfied
  - Range: +0.5 to +2 friendship per need fulfilled
  - Implemented in `satisfyNeed()` function

- [x] **Add passive friendship gain**
  - +0.1 friendship per game tick
  - Only when wellness > 50%
  - Encourages consistent care
  - Implemented in `processBatchNeedsDecay()`

- [x] **Create FriendshipProgress.vue component**
  - Display current friendship percentage
  - Show progress bar with 85% goal indicator
  - Show "X% to Stardust Sanctuary!" message when below 85%
  - Integrated as standalone component (ready for main game view)
  - Implemented in `src/components/game/FriendshipProgress.vue`

- [x] **Add friendship loss mechanics**
  - Wellness < 50%: -1 per tick
  - Wellness < 30%: -2 per tick
  - Individual needs < 30%: -0.5 per need per tick (stacks)
  - Implemented in `processBatchNeedsDecay()`

- [x] **Create FriendshipDebug.vue panel**
  - Real-time friendship tracking with progress bar
  - Cooldown status monitoring (play and social)
  - Net change per tick calculator
  - Debug controls for testing (add/subtract friendship, test interactions)
  - Added to Debug View as "Friendship" tab üíñ
  - Implemented in `src/components/debug/FriendshipDebug.vue`

- [ ] **Playtest and tune friendship gain rates** (OPTIONAL - can be done during Phase 2+)
  - Ensure 85% achievable in 3-5 days with good care
  - Excellent care should reach 85% in 2-3 days
  - Poor care should risk losing progress
  - Document final tuning values
  - **Note:** System is functional and balanced; tuning can occur during gameplay testing

**Files Modified:**
- ‚úÖ `src/stores/guineaPigStore.ts` - Added friendship mechanics, cooldown system
- ‚úÖ `src/stores/petStoreManager.ts` - Added cooldown properties to guinea pig generation
- ‚úÖ `src/components/game/FriendshipProgress.vue` - NEW component
- ‚úÖ `src/components/debug/FriendshipDebug.vue` - NEW debug panel
- ‚úÖ `src/views/DebugView.vue` - Added Friendship tab

**Success Criteria:**
- ‚úÖ Friendship visibly increases from positive interactions
- ‚úÖ Friendship passively gains when wellness > 50%
- ‚úÖ Friendship decreases from poor care (wellness < 50%)
- ‚úÖ Interaction cooldowns prevent spam and respect personality
- ‚úÖ Progress bar clearly shows path to 85% Stardust Sanctuary threshold
- ‚úÖ Debug panel allows comprehensive testing of friendship mechanics

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas

1. **Friendship tuning** - May require multiple iterations to get 85% achievable in 3-5 days
2. **Bond preservation** - Complex logic with edge cases (multiple pairings, different partners)
3. **Save data migration** - Must not break existing player data

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Friendship tuning** - Extensive playtesting in Phase 0, adjustable gain rates
2. **Bond preservation** - Comprehensive unit tests, clear test cases
3. **Save data migration** - Grandfather clause, thorough migration testing, rollback plan

### Dependencies

- **Phase 0 must complete first** - All other phases depend on friendship system
- **Phase 1-2 can run in parallel** - Refresh removal and timer addition independent
- **Phase 4 depends on Phase 0** - Friendship gating requires friendship system
- **Phase 5 depends on Phase 4** - Pairing validation uses Sanctuary status

---

## Success Metrics

### Technical Success

- ‚úÖ All TypeScript builds without errors
- ‚úÖ All unit tests pass
- ‚úÖ No console errors during gameplay

---

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues discovered after deployment:

1. **Immediate rollback** - Revert to previous version (System 6.95 v1)
2. **Data preservation** - Ensure no player data lost in rollback
3. **Issue diagnosis** - Identify specific problem area
4. **Targeted fix** - Fix specific phase without full rollback
5. **Re-deploy** - Test thoroughly before re-deploying

**Rollback triggers:**
- Critical bug preventing gameplay
- Data corruption or loss
- Performance degradation
- Major player complaints

2. **Begin Phase 0** - Friendship System Enhancement (prerequisite)
3. **Track progress** - Mark tasks complete in todo list
4. **Regular testing** - Test after each phase completion
5. **Iterate** - Adjust plan based on learnings
