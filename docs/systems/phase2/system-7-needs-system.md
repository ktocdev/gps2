### Need Value Ranges & Thresholds
- **Critical (0-25%):** Urgent attention required, severe penalties
- **Low (25-50%):** Needs attention, minor penalties and warnings
- **Moderate (50-75%):** Stable but could be improved
- **Good (75-90%):** Well-maintained, positive effects
- **Excellent (90-100%):** Optimal condition, maximum bonuses

### Decay Rate System
- **Variable decay rates** based on guinea pig age and health status
- **Base decay rates** for each need type with individual characteristics
- **Age influences:** Young and old guinea pigs have different needs patterns
- **Health multipliers:** Poor health accelerates certain need decays
- **Environmental modifiers:** Habitat conditions affect decay rates

## Need Interdependencies

### Cross-Need Effects
- **Low health affects other needs:** Sick guinea pigs have accelerated need decay
- **Happiness influences satisfaction:** Happy guinea pigs are more resilient to other need deficits
- **Energy affects activity:** Tired guinea pigs have reduced interaction effectiveness
- **Cleanliness impacts health:** Poor hygiene increases health decay rates

### Cascading Effects
- **Multiple need failures** create compound negative effects
- **Positive synergies** when multiple needs are well-maintained
- **Recovery bonuses** when addressing critical needs quickly
- **Preventive care** rewards for maintaining needs before they become critical

## Detailed Happiness Need System

### Natural Decay Mechanics
- **Baseline decay rate:** Happiness naturally decreases without stimulation
- **Time-based reduction:** Steady decline requiring regular attention
- **Individual variation:** Each guinea pig has unique happiness decay patterns

### Boredom System
- **Variety tracking:** Monitor diversity of interactions and toys over time
- **Accelerated decay:** Happiness drops faster with repetitive activities
- **Staleness penalties:** Same interactions become less effective over time
- **Novelty rewards:** New activities provide enhanced happiness benefits

### Stimulation & Excitement
- **Excitement boost:** New toys/interactions provide temporary happiness surge (+15-25 points)
- **Duration effects:** Boosts fade over time, requiring sustained engagement
- **Diminishing returns:** Repeated use of same stimulation reduces effectiveness
- **Peak management:** Balance between excitement and sustainable happiness

### Comfort & Maintenance
- **Familiar items:** Provide steady happiness baseline with slower decay
- **Comfort zones:** Established preferences that maintain happiness stability
- **Security factors:** Consistent care builds happiness resilience
- **Trust building:** Long-term relationship development affects happiness sustainability

### Environmental Happiness Factors
- **Fresh bedding:** Clean environment provides happiness bonus
- **Cleanliness effects:** Dirty habitat reduces happiness over time
- **Cage enrichment:** Toys, hiding places, and variety boost baseline happiness
- **Seasonal variations:** Environmental changes affect happiness needs

## Detailed Nails Need System

### Natural Growth Mechanics
- **Slow decay rate:** Nails grow gradually, requiring periodic attention (slower than most needs)
- **Age-based variation:** Young guinea pigs have faster nail growth than adults
- **Individual variation:** Each guinea pig has unique nail growth patterns
- **Critical threshold:** Overgrown nails (< 25%) cause discomfort and affect movement

### Nail Clipping Interaction
- **Primary satisfaction method:** "Clip Nails" direct interaction
- **Friendship dependency:** Success rate affected by current friendship level
- **Wellness dependency:** Guinea pig cooperation affected by overall wellness
- **Partial success mechanics:** Low friendship/wellness may prevent complete nail trimming

### Success Rate Calculation
```typescript
successRate = baseSuccessRate + (friendship * 0.3) + (wellness * 0.2)
partialSuccess = successRate < 70% // Some nails remain unclipped
completeSuccess = successRate >= 70% // All nails successfully trimmed
```

### Nail Clipping Outcomes
- **Complete success:** Full nail need restoration (+40-50 points)
- **Partial success:** Moderate improvement (+20-30 points)
- **Minimal success:** Small improvement (+10-15 points)
- **Failure:** No improvement, possible stress reaction

- **Stress acceleration:** Faster decay during loud noises, sudden movements, or environmental changes
- **Individual sensitivity:** Each guinea pig has unique shelter preferences and anxiety thresholds

### Shelter Satisfaction Methods
- **Shelter usage:** Primary satisfaction through hiding in shelter items
- **Secure locations:** Comfort zones near walls, corners, or enclosed areas
- **Bed-shelter combinations:** Enhanced security when resting areas are near hiding spots
- **Environmental familiarity:** Established territory areas provide passive shelter satisfaction

### Shelter Decay Triggers
- **Exposure time:** Extended periods without shelter access increase anxiety
- **Environmental disturbances:** New items, cage cleaning, or layout changes accelerate decay
- **Friendship correlation:** Low friendship amplifies shelter need decay rate
- **Wellness interaction:** Poor overall wellness increases shelter-seeking behavior

### Shelter Preference System
- **Enclosed vs open:** Individual preferences for fully enclosed shelters vs partial coverage
- **Elevation preference:** Some guinea pigs prefer ground-level vs elevated hiding spots
- **Size preference:** Comfort with tight spaces vs spacious shelters
- **Material preference:** Different shelter materials (wood, plastic, fabric) appeal differently

### Shelter Effectiveness Scaling
- **Basic satisfaction:** All shelter items provide standard security benefits
- **Preference bonuses:** Preferred shelter types provide +25% enhanced effectiveness
- **Combination synergy:** Shelter + bed pairings provide +30% bonus to both shelter and energy needs
- **Familiarity bonus:** Regular shelter usage creates comfort zones with +15% effectiveness

### Proactive Shelter Behavior
- **Anxiety prevention:** Guinea pig seeks shelter when need drops below 60%
- **Stress response:** Immediate shelter-seeking during environmental disturbances
- **Comfort checking:** Regular visits to preferred shelters for security reassurance
- **Territory establishment:** Creates secure zones around frequently used shelters

## Weighted Need Groups System

### Need Group Classifications

#### Critical Physical Needs (40% weight)
- **Hunger, Thirst, Energy** - Essential survival needs threatening life if neglected
- **Highest priority** in wellness calculation and gameplay importance
- **Immediate consequences** when these needs reach critical levels
- **Survival imperative** requiring urgent player attention

#### External Environment Needs (25% weight)
- **Social, Cleanliness, Shelter** - Environmental wellness and stress management
- **High importance** for psychological health and comfort
- **Stress amplification** when these needs are neglected affecting other needs
- **Security foundation** providing stability for other need satisfaction

#### Maintenance Needs (20% weight)
- **Chew, Nails, Health** - Ongoing care and long-term health requirements
- **Medium importance** for sustained health and wellness
- **Gradual consequences** with long-term impacts rather than immediate crises

### Weighted Calculation Formula
```typescript
wellness = (criticalPhysicalAverage * 0.40) +
          (externalEnvironmentAverage * 0.25) +
          (maintenanceAverage * 0.20) +
          (happiness * 0.15)

Where:
criticalPhysicalAverage = (hunger + thirst + energy) / 3
