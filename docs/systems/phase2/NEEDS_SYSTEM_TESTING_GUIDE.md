#### Formula Reference:
```
Wellness = (Critical Physical × 40%) + (External Environment × 25%) +
           (Maintenance × 20%) + (Happiness × 15%)

Where:
- Critical Physical = (hunger + thirst + energy) / 3
- External Environment = (social + cleanliness + shelter) / 3
- Maintenance = (chew + nails + health) / 3
- Happiness = happiness value
```
