# Habitat Debug Development Plan

**Phase 3: Game World & Environment**
**Strategic Priority Shift:** Deprioritizing remainder of Phase 2.5 to focus on habitat foundation

## Strategic Rationale

Building the habitat in the debug panel first provides several critical advantages:

1. **Visual development environment** - See habitat conditions, items, and guinea pig interactions in real-time
2. **Natural eating patterns** - Guinea pigs can interact with placed items (hay rack, food dish) more realistically than artificial debug controls
3. **Integration testing** - Test how habitat conditions affect needs, wellness, and behavior
4. **Foundation for Phase 3** - The debug panel becomes the prototype for the actual habitat UI
5. **Better testing environment** - More realistic than debug panels alone for enhanced interactions and activity logs

## Phase 1: Habitat Conditions Store & Basic UI (System 11) ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**

**Goal:** Create the foundational habitat conditions tracking system with debug panel

**Status:** Implemented and tested (Build successful - 283.63 KB JS, 85.99 KB CSS)

### Store Implementation ‚úÖ

Created `src/stores/habitatConditions.ts` (Pinia store) - 326 lines

#### Core State (0-100 Scale)
- **Cleanliness level** - Decreases with poop accumulation, restored by cleaning
  - Poop accumulation tracked per grid cell (small overlays, not full cell occupation)
  - Cleaning action removes all poop overlays from habitat grid
- **Bedding freshness** - Time-based decay rate varies by bedding quality, refreshed using bedding resource
- **Hay freshness** - Time-based decay (faster than bedding), critical for hunger satisfaction
- **Water level** - Decreases when guinea pig drinks, refilled for free

#### Resource Management
- **Bedding inventory** - Consumable resource with quality tiers affecting absorbency and longevity
  - **Cheap Bedding** - Low cost, lower absorbency, faster decay rate
  - **Average Bedding** - Balanced cost/performance, standard absorbency (starting resource: 2-3 units)
  - **Premium Bedding** - Higher cost, superior absorbency, slower decay rate
  - **Colorful Premium Bedding** - Premium quality + visual habitat color changes + stimulation/wellness boost
- **Hay inventory** - Consumable resource, essential for hunger satisfaction
- **Consumption tracking** - Monitor usage rates and patterns across different bedding qualities
- **Inventory integration** - Connect to existing inventory system

#### Decay Mechanisms
- **Time-based decay** - Gradual deterioration aligned with game tick
- **Activity-based changes** - Rapid changes from guinea pig actions
- **Cross-condition dependencies** - Poor cleanliness accelerates bedding/hay decay
- **Maintenance actions** - Player interventions that improve conditions

#### Store State Structure

  }
}
```

#### Cage Size Based on Guinea Pig Count

**1 Guinea Pig - Small Cage:**
- Grid dimensions: 6 cells wide √ó 4 cells tall = **24 total cells**
- Guinea pig occupies: 1 cell
- Starting items occupy: ~6-8 cells
- Free movement space: ~15-17 cells (66-70% free space)
- Realistic representation of minimum recommended cage size

**2 Guinea Pigs - Large Cage:**
- Grid dimensions: 10 cells wide √ó 6 cells tall = **60 total cells**
- Guinea pigs occupy: 2 cells
- Starting items occupy: ~10-14 cells
- Free movement space: ~44-48 cells (73-80% free space)
- Realistic representation of recommended cage size for pair

**Guinea Pig Size:**
- Each guinea pig = 1 cell (same as food bowl)
- Guinea pigs can move to any accessible cell
- Cannot occupy cells with non-stackable items

#### Default Starting Items

**Small Cage (1 Guinea Pig) - 6√ó4 grid:**
1. **Water Bottle** - Top-right (5,0) - 1√ó1 cell, full
2. **Food Bowl** - Bottom-left (0,3) - 1√ó1 cell, pre-filled with 1 handful of hay
3. **Hay Rack** - Bottom-center (2,3) - 1√ó1 cell, pre-filled with 4 handfuls of hay
4. **Small Shelter** - Center-right (4,1) - 2√ó1 cells (2 cells total)
5. **Small Chew Toy** - Center-left (1,1) - 1√ó1 cell

**Large Cage (2 Guinea Pigs) - 10√ó6 grid:**
1. **Water Bottle** - Top-right (9,0) - 1√ó1 cell, full
2. **Food Bowl** - Bottom-left (0,5) - 1√ó1 cell, pre-filled with 1 handful of hay
3. **Hay Rack** - Bottom-center (4,5) - 1√ó1 cell, pre-filled with 4 handfuls of hay
4. **Small Shelter** - Center-right (7,2) - 2√ó1 cells (2 cells total)
5. **Large Shelter** - Center-left (1,2) - 2√ó2 cells (4 cells total)
6. **Small Chew Toy** - Mid-left (2,4) - 1√ó1 cell

#### Starting Resources & Inventory
New game begins with essential supplies to get player started:
- **Average Bedding** - 2-3 units (standard quality, balanced absorbency and longevity)
- **Extra Hay** - 1 full bag (20 handfuls, player's choice of hay type or default Timothy)
- **Hay Rack & Bowl** - Both pre-filled with hay (ready for immediate guinea pig care)
- **Currency** - Starting money for additional purchases from pet store/supplies store

#### Item Sizes & Grid Occupation

**Food Containers:**
- **Hay Rack:** 1√ó1 cell, holds 4 handfuls of hay (hay only)
- **Food Bowl:** 1√ó1 cell, holds 1 handful of hay OR 1 other food (not mixed)
- **Food Plate (Upgrade):** 2√ó2 cells (4 cells total), holds 3 handfuls of hay + multiple other foods simultaneously

**Shelters:**
- **Small Shelter:** 2√ó1 cells (2 cells horizontal)
- **Large Shelter:** 2√ó2 cells (4 cells total)
- **Shelter Top (Stackable):** Same footprint as base item, placed on top layer

**Beds, Toys, Chews:**
- **Small Bed:** 1√ó1 cell (stackable - bottom layer)
- **Large Bed:** 2√ó1 cells (stackable - bottom layer)
- **Small Chew Toy:** 1√ó1 cell (stackable - middle layer)
- **Large Toy:** 2√ó1 cells (stackable - middle layer)

**Other:**
- **Water Bottle:** 1√ó1 cell (attached to wall, not stackable)
- **Guinea Pig:** 1√ó1 cell (moves freely to accessible cells)
- **Poop:** 1/4 cell visual (4 poops can fit in one cell, positioned in quadrants)

#### Item Stacking System

**Stacking is Optional - All items can be placed independently:**
- **Beds** - Can be placed alone OR stacked with toys/chews/shelter tops
- **Toys/Chews** - Can be placed alone OR stacked with beds/shelter tops
- **Shelter Tops** - Can be placed alone OR stacked with beds/toys/chews
- **Standalone Shelters** - Cannot be stacked (always independent items)
- **Food/Water** - Cannot be stacked (always independent items)

**When Stacking (Optional):**
- **Layer Preference:** Bed (bottom) ‚Üí Toy/Chew (middle) ‚Üí Shelter Top (top)
- **Footprint Matching:** All stacked items must have same grid footprint (1√ó1 or 2√ó1 or 2√ó2)
- **Flexible Combinations:** Any valid combination of stackable items works
- **Stack Height:** Maximum 3 items stacked together

**Valid Stacking Examples:**
- Bed alone (1√ó1)
- Toy alone (1√ó1)
- Shelter top alone (1√ó1)
- Bed (1√ó1) + Toy (1√ó1)
- Bed (1√ó1) + Shelter top (1√ó1)
- Toy (1√ó1) + Shelter top (1√ó1)
- Bed (1√ó1) + Toy (1√ó1) + Shelter top (1√ó1)
- Large bed (2√ó1) + Large shelter top (2√ó1)

**Invalid Stacking:**
- Mismatched footprints: Small bed (1√ó1) + Large shelter top (2√ó2)
- More than 3 items in one stack
- Stacking food/water/standalone shelters

**Stacking Benefits:**
- **Space efficiency:** More items in limited cage space (especially critical in small 6√ó4 cage)
- **Enhanced benefits:** Certain combinations provide bonuses (bed + shelter top = +30% sleep quality)
- **Realistic design:** Mimics real guinea pig cage setups with multi-level hideouts
- **Strategic depth:** Players optimize vertical space while maintaining variety

#### Food Types & Daily Requirements

**Food Categories:**
1. **Hay** - Unlimited, always available (primary food source)
2. **Leafy Greens** - Daily requirement: Maximum 2 handfuls/day (romaine lettuce, green leaf lettuce, kale, spinach, etc.)
3. **Veggies** - Treats: Maximum 3 pieces/day total (cherry tomato, carrot slice, cucumber slice, bell pepper piece, etc.)
4. **Pellets** - Optional supplement (small amount if offered)

**Preferences:**
- Guinea pigs have **leafy greens likes/dislikes** (separate from veggie preferences)
- Guinea pigs have **veggie likes/dislikes** (cherry tomatoes, carrots, cucumbers, etc.)
- Hay preferences already exist (Timothy, Orchard Grass, etc.)

**Serving Sizes:**
- **Leafy greens:** Served in "handfuls" (loose greens like a handful of romaine)
- **Veggies:** Served in "pieces" (1 cherry tomato, 1 slice of carrot, 1 cucumber slice)
- **Hay:** Served in "handfuls" from hay bags

#### Food Serving Methods
Different food containers with varying capacities and food type support:

**Hay Rack (1√ó1 cell):**
- **Capacity:** 4 handfuls of hay only
- **Food Types:** Hay only (dedicated hay dispenser)
- **Usage:** Primary hay source, encourages natural grazing behavior
- **Refill:** Add 1 handful at a time (or 3 from mini-bale)
- **Strategic Value:** Highest capacity for hay, but can't serve other foods, space-efficient

**Food Bowl (1√ó1 cell):**
- **Capacity:** (1 handful of hay OR 1 handful of leafy greens) + optional 1 piece of veggie
- **Food Types:** Can hold hay OR leafy greens as base, plus can add 1 veggie piece on top
- **Usage:** Versatile, allows simple combination serving
- **Refill:** Must empty hay/greens before switching, but can always add 1 veggie piece
- **Strategic Value:** Flexibility for different food types, can provide greens + veggie treat in one bowl, space-efficient
- **Examples:**
  - Bowl with 1 handful of romaine lettuce + 1 cherry tomato
  - Bowl with 1 handful of hay + 1 carrot slice
  - Bowl with 1 handful of romaine lettuce (no veggie)
  - Bowl with 1 cherry tomato only (veggie treat without greens/hay)

**Food Plate (2√ó2 cells - Purchasable Upgrade):**
- **Capacity:** 3 handfuls of hay + 2 handfuls of leafy greens + 3 pieces of veggies simultaneously
- **Food Types:** Hay + leafy greens + veggies all at once (mixed servings)
- **Usage:** Premium feeding solution, allows complete variety in one location
- **Refill:** Can add different food types without emptying
- **Strategic Value:** Convenience and variety, reduces refill frequency, supports complete nutrition in one spot
- **Trade-off:** Takes up 4 cells - significant space commitment in small cage (17% of small cage!)
- **Example:** Plate with 3 handfuls hay + 2 handfuls romaine + 1 cherry tomato + 1 carrot slice + 1 cucumber piece

#### Placement Validation

**Basic Rules:**
- **Grid bounds checking** - Items must fit within grid dimensions
- **Overlap prevention** - No items can occupy same cells (except stacking)
- **Accessibility rules** - Items must be reachable from at least one adjacent cell
- **Guinea pig movement** - Must maintain pathways for guinea pig to navigate

**Stacking Validation (When Player Chooses to Stack):**
- **Footprint matching** - All stacked items must have identical grid footprint
- **Layer preference** - Visual layer order: bed (bottom) ‚Üí toy/chew (middle) ‚Üí shelter top (top)
- **Flexible stacking** - Any combination of stackable items works (bed+toy, toy+shelter, bed+shelter, all three, etc.)
- **One item per layer type** - Each layer can only have one item
- **Independence** - All stackable items can also be placed alone without stacking

**Item-Specific Constraints:**
- **Water bottles** - Must be against a wall (edge cell)
- **Food plates** - Need 2√ó2 clear space, cannot be stacked
- **Shelters** - Need entrance side accessible (at least one adjacent cell open)
- **Non-stackable items** - Food containers, water bottles, standalone shelters block stacking

### HabitatDebug Grid Visualization Enhancement

#### Grid Display Panel

## Phase 3: Guinea Pig Interaction with Habitat Items

**Goal:** Guinea pigs autonomously use placed items based on needs

### Autonomous Item Usage System

#### Need-Based Item Selection
**Item Selection AI:**
- **Hunger** ‚Üí Hay rack (if hay fresh > 40%), Food dish (if food present)
- **Thirst** ‚Üí Water bottle (if water level > 0%)
- **Shelter** ‚Üí Shelters, hideouts (preference-based selection)
- **Play/Stimulation** ‚Üí Toys, tunnels, chew items
- **Comfort** ‚Üí Beds, soft hideouts, cozy shelters
- **Social** ‚Üí Multi-guinea pig items, shared spaces

**Selection Priority Algorithm:**
1. Check need urgency (lowest need gets priority)
2. Find items that satisfy that need
3. Filter by availability (not in use, accessible)
4. Rank by preference match (guinea pig preferences)
5. Rank by effectiveness (fresher/better items preferred)
6. Rank by proximity (closer items preferred)
7. Select highest-ranked item

#### Usage Patterns & Behaviors
**Realistic Interaction:**
- **Approach Animation** - Guinea pig moves to item's grid position
- **Interaction Duration** - Varies by item type and need urgency
  - Hay eating: 10-15 seconds (partial consumption)
  - Water drinking: 3-5 seconds
  - Shelter hiding: 30-60 seconds (longer if stressed)
  - Toy play: 15-30 seconds
  - Bed sleeping: 60-300 seconds (based on energy need)
- **Need Satisfaction** - Item usage increases corresponding need value
- **Effectiveness Impact** - Better items provide faster/greater satisfaction

**Usage Tracking:**
- **Item Usage Counter** - Increment each time item is used
- **Last Used Timestamp** - Record when guinea pig last interacted
- **Cumulative Duration** - Total time spent with each item
- **Preference Learning** - Track which items are favorites (used more often)

#### Eating Pattern Integration
**Natural Eating Mechanics:**
- **Hay Eating (Unlimited):**
  - Duration: 10-15 seconds per eating session
  - Consumption: 30-70% hunger satisfaction (partial, realistic)
  - Hay depletion: Each eating session consumes 1 handful from container
  - Frequency: Multiple eating sessions throughout day
  - Critical dependency: Requires hay freshness above personality threshold AND handfuls in container > 0
  - Empty container: Guinea pig cannot eat autonomously from that container

- **Leafy Greens Eating (Daily Requirement: 2 handfuls):**
  - Duration: 8-12 seconds per handful
  - Consumption: 15-25% hunger satisfaction per handful
  - Daily limit: Maximum 2 handfuls/day (hard limit, nutritional balance)
  - Preference impact: Liked greens eaten eagerly, disliked greens eaten reluctantly or refused
  - Examples: Romaine lettuce, green leaf lettuce, kale (small amounts), spinach (small amounts)
  - Can be served in bowl (1 handful) or plate (2 handfuls)

- **Veggie Eating (Treats: Max 3 pieces/day):**
  - Duration: 5-8 seconds per piece
  - Consumption: 5-15% hunger satisfaction per piece (smaller than greens)
  - Daily limit: Maximum 3 pieces total across all veggie types
  - Preference impact: Liked veggies provide stimulation/wellness bonus, disliked veggies may be refused
  - Examples: Cherry tomato (1 piece), carrot slice (1 piece), cucumber slice (1 piece), bell pepper piece (1 piece)
  - Can be served alone, with hay, or with leafy greens in bowl

- **Food Bowl Eating:**
  - Capacity: (1 handful of hay OR 1 handful of leafy greens) + optional 1 piece of veggie
  - Can serve hay with veggie, greens with veggie, or just veggie alone
  - Must empty hay/greens before switching between them, but veggie can be added anytime
  - Examples: "Romaine + cherry tomato", "Hay + carrot slice", "Cherry tomato only"

- **Food Plate Eating (Premium):**
  - Capacity: 3 handfuls of hay + 2 handfuls of leafy greens + 3 pieces of veggies simultaneously
  - Guinea pig can choose from variety autonomously (will prioritize based on preferences and needs)
  - Supports complete daily nutrition in one location (hay + 2 handfuls greens + veggie treats)
  - Convenience reduces player micromanagement

**Consumption Limits:**
- **Hay** - Unlimited, always available (primary food source)
- **Leafy Greens** - Maximum 2 handfuls/day (hard limit, nutritional requirement)
- **Veggies** - Maximum 3 pieces/day total (hard limit, prevents overfeeding treats)
- **Cooldown Periods** - Time between eating sessions (~30-60 minutes)
- **Hunger Threshold** - Won't eat if hunger > 80%
- **Preference Filtering** - Won't eat disliked foods even if hungry (may skip disliked leafy greens or veggies)

- **Higher standards** - Comfort need decays faster when habitat conditions drop below 60%
- **Hay freshness threshold** - Won't eat hay below 60% freshness (vs 40% baseline)
- **Bedding sensitivity** - Bedding freshness below 50% causes comfort penalties
- **Cleanliness stress** - Cage cleanliness below 50% causes anxiety (-5 to -10 comfort/hour)
- **Activity messages:**
  - "Guinea pig wrinkles nose at the stale hay"
  - "Guinea pig seems uncomfortable with the messy cage"
  - "Guinea pig appreciates the fresh, clean habitat!"

**Piggy/Unbothered (Low Cleanliness 1-3):**
- **Tolerant of mess** - Will eat hay down to 20% freshness (vs 40% baseline)
- **Unfazed by dirt** - Comfort need unaffected until cleanliness drops below 30%
- **Not picky** - Bedding freshness doesn't impact comfort until below 25%
- **Easy-going** - No stress penalties from habitat conditions unless critical (< 20%)
- **Activity messages:**
  - "Guinea pig happily munches the hay without concern"
  - "Guinea pig doesn't seem bothered by the messy cage"
  - "Guinea pig is content in any conditions"

**Moderate Cleanliness (4-6):**
- **Baseline behavior** - Standard thresholds (40% hay, 40% bedding, 40% cleanliness)
- **Balanced tolerance** - Neither finicky nor unbothered

**Cleanliness Modifiers:**
```typescript
// Hay freshness eating threshold
hayFreshnessThreshold = {
  picky (7-10): 60%      // Won't eat below this
  moderate (4-6): 40%    // Baseline
  piggy (1-3): 20%       // Very tolerant
}

// Comfort penalty from poor cleanliness
if (cleanliness < cleanlinessThreshold) {
  const cleanlinessPersonality = guineaPig.personality.cleanliness
  if (cleanlinessPersonality >= 7) {
    // Picky: starts penalties at 50%, severe at 30%
    comfortPenalty = (50 - cleanliness) * 0.3
  } else if (cleanlinessPersonality <= 3) {
    // Piggy: only penalized below 30%, mild penalties
    comfortPenalty = cleanliness < 30 ? (30 - cleanliness) * 0.1 : 0
  } else {
    // Moderate: baseline penalties starting at 40%
    comfortPenalty = (40 - cleanliness) * 0.2
  }
}

// Bedding freshness comfort impact
if (beddingFreshness < beddingThreshold) {
  if (cleanlinessPersonality >= 7) {
    // Picky: uncomfortable with bedding < 50%
    beddingPenalty = (50 - beddingFreshness) * 0.2
  } else if (cleanlinessPersonality <= 3) {
    // Piggy: only cares below 25%
    beddingPenalty = beddingFreshness < 25 ? (25 - beddingFreshness) * 0.1 : 0
  }
}
```

**Debug Panel Display:**
- **Cleanliness Trait Slider** - Adjust 1-10 for testing
- **Current Thresholds Display** - Show active hay/bedding/cleanliness thresholds based on personality

### Design Patterns (Consistent with Existing)

#### Component Structure
- **Script Setup** - `<script setup lang="ts">` composition API
- **TypeScript** - Explicit types for all props, emits, state
- **Pinia Stores** - State management via stores, not component state
- **Composables** - Reusable logic extracted to composables when appropriate
- **Icon Component** - Use `<Icon>` component with Iconify for all icons
  - Supports multiple icon families via `family` prop (flowbite, mdi, carbon, heroicons, lucide, etc.)
  - Default family: `flowbite`
  - Can specify full icon name with family prefix: `icon="mdi:circle-small"`
  - Or use family prop: `family="mdi" icon="circle-small"`

#### Layout Patterns
- **Single-Column** - Mobile-first, responsive layout
- **Panel System** - Consistent panel components:
  - `panel--compact` - Reduced padding
  - `panel--accent` - Highlighted panel
  - `panel--bordered` - Visible borders
- **Constrained Width** - Max 1440px for readability
- **Container Queries** - Component-responsive design

  - Game paused (`gameController.isPaused`)
  - System paused (e.g., `needsController.processingEnabled === false`)
  - Insufficient resources
  - Invalid state
- **Tooltip Feedback** - Explain why action is disabled

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Needs System Integration

#### Habitat Conditions Affect Needs
**Cleanliness Impact:**
- Low cleanliness (< 40%) ‚Üí Comfort need decays 25% faster
- Very low cleanliness (< 20%) ‚Üí Comfort need decays 50% faster
- Cleanliness affects guinea pig's personal cleanliness need

**Hay Rack Impact (Critical):**
- Hay freshness > 40% AND handfuls > 0 ‚Üí Autonomous hunger satisfaction enabled
- Hay freshness 20-40% OR handfuls 1-5 ‚Üí Reduced hunger satisfaction (70% effectiveness)
- Hay freshness < 20% OR handfuls = 0 ‚Üí No autonomous hunger satisfaction
- Empty hay bag (0 handfuls) ‚Üí Guinea pig relies on hand feeding only, freshness immediately drops to 0%

**Bedding Impact:**
- Fresh bedding (> 80%) ‚Üí Comfort need bonus (+5-10 points/hour)
- Stale bedding (< 40%) ‚Üí Comfort need penalty (-5-10 points/hour)
- Bed + fresh bedding ‚Üí Enhanced sleep quality (faster energy recovery)

**Water Impact:**
- Water level > 20% ‚Üí Autonomous thirst satisfaction enabled
- Water level < 20% ‚Üí Warning notification
- Water level = 0% ‚Üí No autonomous thirst satisfaction

#### Wellness Calculation Input
**Habitat Contribution to Wellness:**
```typescript
habitatWellnessScore = (
  (cleanliness * 0.25) +
  (beddingFreshness * 0.20) +
  (hayFreshness * 0.35) + // Highest weight - critical for survival
  (waterLevel * 0.20)
) / 100

// Habitat contributes 15-25% to overall wellness
totalWellness = needsScore * 0.60 + habitatScore * 0.20 + friendshipScore * 0.20
```

**Poor Conditions Penalties:**
- Any condition < 40% ‚Üí Wellness penalty (-5 to -15 points)
- Multiple conditions < 40% ‚Üí Compound penalties
- Critical condition (< 20%) ‚Üí Severe wellness penalty (-20 to -30 points)

### Inventory System Integration

#### Resource Consumption
**Bedding Management:**
- **Purchase from Store** - Via existing inventory/store system, multiple quality tiers
  - **Cheap Bedding** - Lowest cost, basic performance (0.8x absorbency, 1.2x decay rate)
  - **Average Bedding** - Mid-tier pricing, balanced performance (1x absorbency, 1x decay) - **Starting resource: 2-3 units**
  - **Premium Bedding** - Higher cost, superior performance (1.3x absorbency, 0.7x decay)
  - **Colorful Premium Bedding** - Premium cost, premium performance + visual effects + stimulation/wellness bonus
    - Available colors: Blue, Pink, Purple, Green, Yellow, Orange
    - Each color changes habitat visual theme
    - +5-10% stimulation satisfaction bonus contributing to overall wellness
- **Consumption on Use** - Each bedding refresh consumes 1 bedding unit of selected type (unless Free Resources enabled)
- **Quality Effects** - Better bedding = slower cleanliness decay + longer bedding freshness
- **Inventory Tracking** - Separate tracking for each bedding quality tier
- **Cost Pressure** - Strategic choice: cheap & frequent vs premium & infrequent replacement
- **Free Resources Mode (Debug)** - When enabled in debug panel, unlimited bedding without depletion

**Hay Management:**
- **Purchase from Store** - Multiple hay types with different costs/preferences (bags of 20 handfuls)
- **Mini-Hay Bales** - Premium treat option from supplies store: adds 3 handfuls with special benefits
  - Higher hunger satisfaction (1.5x per handful vs regular hay)
  - Faster depletion (guinea pigs consume more eagerly)
  - Stimulation bonus when eaten (+5-10 stimulation points)
  - Friendship bonus when served (+2-5 friendship points for the special treat)
- **Consumption on Use** - Each hay refill adds 1 handful to food container (or 3 from mini-bale), depletes current bag by corresponding amount (unless Free Resources enabled)
- **Container-Specific Capacities:**
  - Hay Rack: Holds 4 handfuls max (hay only, dedicated hay dispenser)
  - Food Bowl: Holds 1 handful max (hay OR other food, not mixed)
  - Food Plate: Holds 3 handfuls max (hay AND other foods simultaneously)
- **Handful Depletion** - Each guinea pig eating session consumes 1 handful from any container (unless Free Resources enabled)
- **Critical Resource** - Essential for hunger satisfaction
- **Type Selection** - Choose which hay bag from inventory to use for refilling, or use mini-bale for special treat benefits
- **Empty Bag** - When handfuls reach 0, bag is depleted and must switch to new bag or purchase more
- **Free Resources Mode (Debug)** - When enabled in debug panel, unlimited hay/mini-bales without depletion

#### Quick Purchase Integration
**Debug Panel Convenience:**
- **Quick Add Resources** - Add bedding/hay directly (for testing)
- **Enable Free Resources** - Toggle for unlimited resources (bypasses Supplies Store dependency)
  - Allows complete habitat testing before store integration
  - Resources still tracked but never depleted
  - Visual indicator in panel when active
- **Jump to Store** - Button to open InventoryDebug/PetStoreDebug (when implemented)
- **Real Consumption** - Resources consumed from inventory (unless Free Resources enabled)
- **Cost Tracking** - Monitor spending on habitat maintenance (when store integrated)

#### Replacement of FeedingDebug
The Habitat Debug panel completely replaces the existing FeedingDebug functionality:

**Features Migrated from FeedingDebug:**
- Food serving (now via food containers in habitat grid)
- Hay management (now via hay rack/bowl/plate with handful tracking)
- Feeding tracking (now via eating cycle tracking panel)
- Daily limits (now enforced via leafy greens and veggie limits)

**New Capabilities Beyond FeedingDebug:**
- Visual habitat grid with item placement
- Multiple food container types with different capacities
- Leafy greens vs veggie distinction with separate limits
- Habitat conditions affecting feeding (hay freshness, cleanliness)
- Guinea pig position and autonomous eating from containers
- Preference-based food selection from multiple options

**Cleanup Steps (Phase 5):**
1. Remove `src/components/debug/FeedingDebug.vue`
2. Remove `src/views/FeedingDebugView.vue`
3. Update `src/views/DebugView.vue` to remove feeding tab from navigation
4. Archive any unique feeding debug features not yet in habitat debug
5. Update documentation to reference Habitat Debug for feeding testing

   - Emergency scenarios: Can player recover from mistakes?

3. **Item Effectiveness**
   - Bed-shelter bonus: Noticeable improvement (30%)?
   - Staleness decay: Encourages rotation without forcing it?
   - Preference matching: Meaningful gameplay impact (25% bonus)?

#### Edge Case Testing
1. **Simultaneous Resource Depletion**
   - Empty hay + empty water + no bedding + low cleanliness
   - Verify alerts prioritize correctly (hay most critical)
   - Test recovery path

2. **Extreme Values**
   - All conditions at 0%
   - All conditions at 100%
   - Negative values (shouldn't happen)
   - Values > 100 (shouldn't happen)

3. **Rapid State Changes**
   - Quick succession of maintenance actions
   - Multiple guinea pigs using same item simultaneously
   - Pause/resume during actions
   - Fast-forward time simulation

## Future Enhancements & Phase 3 Transition

### From Debug Panel ‚Üí Production UI
**The habitat debug panel becomes the foundation for:**
1. **Player-Facing Habitat View** - Main game screen showing guinea pig in habitat
2. **Item Shop Integration** - Purchase items from store and place in habitat
3. **Habitat Customization** - Themes, decorations, aesthetic choices
4. **Advanced Features** - Multiple guinea pigs, seasonal decorations, events

### Phase 3 Full Habitat System
**Building upon this foundation:**
- Visual guinea pig sprites with animations
- Realistic movement pathfinding through grid
- Advanced item interactions (multi-step behaviors)
- Environmental effects (temperature, lighting)
- Habitat expansion and upgrades
- Community features (habitat sharing, competitions)

### Autonomous Behavior Foundation (Phase 4)
**Habitat enables autonomy:**
- Guinea pigs choose items autonomously based on needs
- Natural behavior patterns emerge from item variety
- Item rotation creates dynamic environment requiring player engagement
- Resource management creates ongoing gameplay loop
- Foundation for full autonomous guinea pig AI
