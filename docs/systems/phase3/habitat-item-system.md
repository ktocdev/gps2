- **Freshness duration** - novelty effects last for defined periods before decay begins
- **Reintroduction benefits** - stored items regain some effectiveness when returned

### Strategic Storage & Rotation
- **Item storage system** - players can remove items to habitat inventory for rotation
- **Storage capacity** - limited storage encourages strategic planning
- **Rotation planning** - players develop optimal item cycling strategies
- **Novelty maintenance** - continuous variety management for sustained happiness

### Item Combination Synergies
- **Synergy bonuses** - certain item combinations create enhanced effects
- **Environmental themes** - related items provide compound benefits
- **Activity combinations** - tunnel + platform = exploration bonus
- **Discovery rewards** - players find effective combinations through experimentation

## Advanced Item Features

### Quality & Durability System
- **Item effectiveness** varies based on quality levels (basic, standard, premium)
- **Durability tracking** - items wear over time requiring replacement
