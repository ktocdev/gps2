## 🎉 **Phase 3 Complete!**

### System 16: Autonomy Preparation ✅ **ALL 5 PHASES COMPLETE**

**Status:** ✅ Completed October 20, 2025
**Implementation Time:** ~6 hours (faster than 8-13 hour estimate)

All autonomy foundation systems implemented and tested:
- ✅ **Phase 1:** Item Type Metadata - itemType, needSatisfied, satisfactionAmount
- ✅ **Phase 2:** Water Consumption - consumeWater, hasWaterAvailable, getWaterBottlePosition
- ✅ **Phase 3:** Environmental Decay - Time-based bedding/cleanliness decay with quality modifiers
- ✅ **Phase 4:** Guinea Pig Position Tracking - Grid positioning with collision detection
- ✅ **Phase 5:** Item Usage History - Effectiveness tracking with rotation mechanics

**Key Features:**
- Constants centralized in [supplies.ts](../src/constants/supplies.ts#L75-L94)
- All decay rates tunable and well-documented
- Position tracking with Map-based storage
- Item effectiveness decay encourages strategic rotation
- Hourly recovery system for unused items
- Full persistence across page reloads

**Files Modified:**
- `src/constants/supplies.ts` - Added DECAY constants
- `src/stores/habitatConditions.ts` - Added all 5 phase systems
- `src/stores/gameTimingStore.ts` - Integrated decay and recovery
- `src/stores/guineaPigStore.ts` - Position initialization on activation

## 🎨 **Habitat Debug Cleanup** ✅ **COMPLETE**

**Status:** ✅ Completed October 20, 2025
**Goal:** Improve decay system UX and container drag behavior

### Decay Speed Control System

**Added configurable decay speed multiplier for testing and game balance:**
- ✅ **Speed Presets** - Realistic (1x), Relaxed (6x), Normal (12x), Fast (24x), Debug (60x)
- ✅ **Default: 12x (Normal)** - Balanced for 10-15 minute casual play sessions
- ✅ **Slider Control** - Range 1-60x with preset buttons in HabitatDebug panel
- ✅ **Applied to all decay** - Bedding, cleanliness, and hay freshness

**Decay Timeline at Normal Speed (12x):**
| Item | 1% Loss | Full Decay (100% → 0%) |
|------|---------|------------------------|
| **Hay** | 15 sec | 25 minutes |
| **Bedding** | 25 sec | 42 minutes |
| **Cleanliness** | 50 sec | 83 minutes |

**In a 10-minute session:** Hay drops ~40%, Bedding ~24%, Cleanliness ~12%

### Per-Rack Hay Freshness Tracking

**Implemented individual freshness tracking for each hay rack:**
- ✅ **HayRackData structure** - Each rack tracks servings, freshness (0-100%), and last decay update
- ✅ **Independent decay** - Each hay rack decays separately based on time
- ✅ **Freshness in tooltips** - Hover shows "Freshness: 87%" for each rack
- ✅ **Faster decay rate** - Hay decays at 1 point per 3 minutes (faster than bedding - hay oxidizes quickly!)
- ✅ **Persistence** - Freshness saved per rack across page reloads

### Container Drag Improvements

**Removed drag locks and improved UX for bowls and hay racks:**
- ✅ **Always draggable** - Bowls and hay racks can be moved even when containing food/hay
- ✅ **Content stays put** - Food/hay items cannot be dragged out of containers (pointer-events: none)
- ✅ **Rich tooltips** - Show helpful metadata instead of lock error messages:
  - Empty: "Empty bowl / Capacity: 3 servings"
  - With contents: "Contents: Carrot, Apple / Capacity: 2/3"
  - Hay racks: "Hay servings: 3/4 / Freshness: 87%"
- ✅ **Removed visual locks** - No more dashed borders or "not-allowed" cursors
- ✅ **Help cursor** - Standard grab/grabbing cursor for all items

**Files Modified:**
- `src/constants/supplies.ts` - Added DECAY.SPEED_PRESETS and HAY_BASE_DECAY_PER_SECOND
- `src/stores/habitatConditions.ts` - Added decaySpeedMultiplier, setDecaySpeed(), per-rack hay decay
- `src/composables/useHabitatContainers.ts` - Restructured hay racks to track freshness per rack
- `src/components/debug/environment/HabitatDebug.vue` - Added decay speed slider with presets
- `src/components/game/habitat/HayRack.vue` - Added freshness prop and tooltip, fixed pointer-events
- `src/components/game/habitat/FoodBowl.vue` - Fixed pointer-events on food items
- `src/components/game/habitat/HabitatVisual.vue` - Removed drag locks, improved tooltips

## 🚀 **Phase 4: Guinea Pig Autonomy**

**Status:** 📋 Ready to Start
**Priority:** HIGH
**Estimated Time:** 15-25 hours

### Goal
Implement autonomous guinea pig behavior with need-based decision making, pathfinding, and intelligent item usage.

### Core Systems

#### **4.1: Autonomous Behavior System**
- Need-based behavior triggers (thirst → seek water, hunger → seek food)
- Priority queue for competing needs
- Personality-influenced decision making
- Friendship-gated behaviors

#### **4.2: Pathfinding & Movement**
- A* pathfinding on habitat grid
- Smooth sprite movement between cells
- Obstacle avoidance (items block paths)
- Multiple guinea pigs don't collide

#### **4.3: Item Interaction AI**
- Autonomous water drinking when thirsty
- Autonomous food consumption from bowls
- Hay eating from hay racks
- Shelter seeking when stressed
- Toy/chew item usage for happiness

#### **4.4: Guinea Pig Sprites & Animation**
- Visual representation on habitat grid
- Movement animations (walking, idle)
- Activity animations (drinking, eating, sleeping)
- Breed-specific appearances

### Integration Points
- ✅ Position tracking (System 16 Phase 4)
- ✅ Item type metadata (System 16 Phase 1)
- ✅ Water consumption (System 16 Phase 2)
- ✅ Usage history (System 16 Phase 5)
- ✅ Needs system (Phase 2)
- ✅ Habitat conditions (Phase 3)

## 🎯 **High Priority Improvements**

### Currency Reward System 🔥
**Goal:** Implement currency earning system that rewards good guinea pig care

**Concept:** Friendship Dividends - Guinea pigs earn currency based on friendship points × wellness
- Active pigs: `(friendshipPoints / 100) × (wellness / 100) × 20 = currency/hour`
- Sanctuary pigs: `(friendshipPoints / 100) × 30 = currency/hour` (higher rate, friendship-only)
- Offline accumulation (8-hour cap to prevent FOMO)
- Bonus systems: Daily login (+100), interactions (+5 each), friendship milestones (250-2000 points)
- Self-balancing economy that scales with progression and rewards long-term bonds

**Documentation:** [Currency Reward System Design](game-design/currency-reward-system.md)

**Implementation Priority:** HIGH - Required before expanding supplies catalog

---

### Friendship System Redesign 🔥
**Goal:** Change from percentage (0-100%) to infinite point-based with levels

**Key Changes:**
- Point-based progression (not capped at 100%)
- 10+ tiered levels (Level 4 = Stardust Sanctuary unlock)
- Migration: existing friendship % × 10 = starting points

**Files:** guineaPig.ts, guineaPigStore.ts, petStoreManager.ts, GuineaPigEditor.vue

---

### Port Real Food Items to Preferences 🔥
**Goal:** Replace hardcoded food arrays with Supplies Store catalog

**Implementation:**
- Pull food from `suppliesStore.getFoodByCategory()` instead of hardcoded lists
- Update preference generation to use real item IDs
- Validate guinea pig preferences against Supplies Store

**Files:** GuineaPigEditor.vue, petStoreManager.ts, guineaPigStore.ts

---

### Personality-Based Habitat Sensitivity 🔥
**Goal:** Add 5th personality trait (cleanliness 1-10) affecting habitat tolerance

**Trait Effects:**
- **Picky (7-10):** Won't eat hay <60% fresh, stressed by mess
- **Moderate (4-6):** Baseline 40% thresholds
- **Piggy (1-3):** Tolerates mess, eats hay down to 20% fresh

**Files:** guineaPig.ts, guineaPigStore.ts, habitatConditions.ts, needsController.ts, messageGenerator.ts

## 🔧 **Technical Improvements**

### Smart Bedding Consumption System
**Priority:** MEDIUM (Quality of Life)
**Status:** 📋 Not Started

**Current Issue:** "Refresh Bedding" button always consumes 1 entire bag of bedding regardless of how dirty the habitat is.

**Goal:** Implement smart bedding consumption that uses partial bags based on actual habitat needs.

**Requirements:**
- 1 bag of bedding = 1 full medium habitat space (100% bedding coverage)
- Calculate how much bedding is needed based on current cleanliness level
- Only consume the amount needed (e.g., if habitat is 60% clean, only consume 40% of a bag)
- Similar implementation to hay handful system but for bedding refresh
- If multiple partial bags exist, combine them before opening new bags
- Track partial bags in inventory (e.g., "Average Bedding - 60% remaining")

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/stores/habitatConditions.ts` - Update `refreshBedding()` method with smart consumption
- `src/stores/inventoryStore.ts` - Add partial bag tracking for bedding
- `src/components/debug/environment/HabitatDebug.vue` - Update UI to show partial bag info
