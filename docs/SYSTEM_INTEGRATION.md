## Key Technical Considerations

### Performance Optimization

#### Game Loop Efficiency
- Use `setInterval` with proper cleanup for game loops
- Implement **efficient batch processing** for multiple needs, wellness calculations, and habitat conditions
- **Optimize habitat condition updates** - bedding decay, water consumption, cleanliness changes
- **Resource management efficiency** - track bedding inventory without excessive state updates

#### Responsive Performance
- **Throttle resize events** (100-200ms) to prevent excessive layout recalculations
- **Debounce orientation changes** (300ms) to avoid rapid modal show/hide
- **Container-query optimization** with performance-optimized observation
- **Smart rendering** to minimize unnecessary UI updates

### Architecture Design Principles

#### Extensibility
- **Design for extensibility** - easy to add new needs/features/habitat conditions
- **Modular system architecture** enabling independent system development
- **Plugin-like enhancement** capabilities for future features
- **Backward compatibility** maintenance across system updates

#### Type Safety & Development
- **TypeScript interfaces** for strong typing across all systems
- **Consistent API patterns** for store and component interactions
- **Comprehensive error handling** with graceful degradation
- **Development tool integration** for efficient debugging and testing

#### State Management Strategy
- **Session-based persistence model**:
  - **Session State**: Guinea pig needs, habitat conditions, activity feed (clears on game end)
  - **Persistent State**: Player currency, owned items, achievements, statistics (survives sessions)
  - **Pet Store State**: 10 guinea pig pool with swap cooldown management
  - **End Game Penalty**: Currency deduction when returning guinea pigs to store
- **Performance optimization for frequent updates** - The game's continuous loop creates multiple performance challenges:
  - **Wellness recalculation** happens every game tick (1-5 seconds) to check friendship penalties
  - **Habitat condition monitoring** tracks cleanliness decay, bedding freshness, and water consumption on different schedules
  - **Cross-system reactivity** where changes in one store trigger updates across multiple connected stores
  - **Mitigation strategies**: Batch calculations, throttle non-critical updates, cache frequently accessed values, optimize reactive subscriptions
- **Efficient reactivity** through targeted state observations
- **Memory management** for long-running game sessions
