# Happiness Need System - Entertainment & Enrichment

## Overview
Complex happiness system focused on variety, novelty, and strategic item management to prevent boredom and maintain guinea pig entertainment and emotional wellbeing.

## Core Happiness Mechanics

### Natural Decay System
- **Baseline happiness decrease:** Natural reduction over time requiring active maintenance
- **Slower than survival needs:** Happiness decays more gradually than hunger/thirst
- **Stimulation requirement:** Regular entertainment needed to maintain happiness levels
- **Individual variation:** Each guinea pig has unique happiness decay patterns

### Boredom Acceleration
- **Repetitive activity penalty:** Faster decay when using same toys/interactions repeatedly
- **Staleness effect:** Familiar activities become less effective over time
- **Variety incentive:** System encourages diverse interaction patterns
- **Strategic rotation:** Players must actively manage item variety for effectiveness

### Variety & Novelty Bonuses
- **New item bonus:** Recently introduced items provide happiness boost (+15-25 points)
- **Rotation recovery:** Previously stored items regain some effectiveness when reintroduced
- **Discovery excitement:** First-time use of items provides maximum happiness benefit
- **Novelty duration:** New item bonuses fade over time, requiring continued variety

### Interaction Scaling
- **Varied effectiveness:** Different interaction types provide different happiness benefits
- **Range:** +5 to +20 happiness points based on interaction type and timing
- **Context sensitivity:** Same interaction may provide different benefits based on circumstances
- **Skill development:** Players learn which interactions provide optimal happiness

## Happiness Sources by Category
