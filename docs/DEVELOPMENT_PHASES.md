9. **[Habitat Conditions Store](docs/systems/phase2/habitat-conditions.md)** - Environmental condition tracking (cleanliness, bedding freshness, water level) with resource management
10. **[Interval Management System](docs/systems/phase2/game-timing.md)** - Game timing that drives needs decay, friendship penalties, and habitat condition changes
11. **[Game Loop Integration](docs/systems/phase2/game-timing.md)** - Connect needs system with timing for core functionality including wellness-to-friendship feedback and habitat-to-needs integration

### Key Deliverables
- **Functional guinea pig creation** with hidden preference generation
- **Complete needs system** with all 7 needs categories and interdependencies
- **Wellness calculation system** (internal only) with friendship penalties
- **Habitat conditions** separate from guinea pig needs with resource management
- **Game timing coordination** with pause/resume and orientation integration
- **Preference discovery mechanics** through guinea pig reactions
- **Activity feed integration** with all systems for real-time player feedback

### Integration Focus
- Connect all systems to existing UI placeholders from Phase 1
- Integrate with debug menu for comprehensive testing capabilities
- Ensure responsive design works across all device constraints
- Validate activity feed provides clear feedback for all interactions

## Phase 3: Game World & Environment (Systems 12-14)
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**Goal:** Build interactive habitat with item placement, inventory, and maintenance systems

### Systems
12. **Habitat Item System** - Item placement (connect to habitat grid placeholders)
13. **Inventory & Store System** - Item and resource management including bedding (connect to inventory/store UI placeholders)
14. **Habitat Maintenance & Hygiene System** - Enhanced poop system, cleanliness, bedding, and water management (connect to maintenance menu and habitat status display placeholders)

### Key Deliverables
- **Grid-based habitat layout** with drag & drop item placement
- **Complete item interaction system** with guinea pig autonomous usage
- **Store and inventory management** with currency and resource systems
- **Enhanced poop and cleanliness system** with visual feedback
- **Bedding as consumable resource** with strategic purchasing decisions
- **Happiness-focused item categories** with effectiveness and rotation systems

### Economic Integration
- **Bedding resource management** creating ongoing economic gameplay
- **Item effectiveness system** with newness bonuses and familiarity decay
- **Strategic purchasing decisions** balancing happiness items vs necessities
- **Currency earning** through guinea pig care and achievement milestones

## Phase 4: Interactions & Behaviors (Systems 15-16)
**Duration:** 2-3 weeks
**Goal:** Implement direct interactions and guinea pig AI for complete gameplay loop

### Systems
15. **Direct Interaction System** - User-guinea pig interactions (connect to interaction menu placeholders)
16. **Guinea Pig Autonomy System** - AI behavior and pathfinding (connect to behavior indicator placeholders)

## Cross-Phase Strategies

### Early Implementation Priorities
- **Debug system first** - Essential for efficient development and testing
- **Activity feed integration** - Immediate feedback before animations are available
- **Responsive framework early** - Handle all device scenarios from the beginning
- **UI placeholders complete** - Enable immediate visual validation of backend systems

### Integration Approach
- **Connect to existing placeholders** - Each phase builds on Phase 1 UI framework
- **Progressive enhancement** - Core functionality first, polish later
- **System validation** - Debug tools enable thorough testing at each phase
- **User feedback incorporation** - Activity feed provides immediate usability validation

### Risk Mitigation
- **Early foundation investment** - Comprehensive Phase 1 setup enables rapid subsequent development
- **Debug-driven development** - Continuous validation prevents accumulation of integration issues
- **Responsive design priority** - Mobile constraints addressed from beginning, not retrofitted
- **Text-based feedback first** - Activity feed provides complete user experience before animations

### Success Metrics
- **Phase 1:** Complete UI framework with all placeholders and debug capabilities
- **Phase 2:** Functional guinea pig simulation with all core needs and timing systems
- **Phase 3:** Economic gameplay with habitat management and item interactions
- **Phase 4:** Complete gameplay loop with AI behaviors and interaction systems
- **Phase 5:** Polished experience with progression systems and optional enhancements

This phased approach ensures steady progress with continuous validation, early risk mitigation, and a complete playable game by Phase 4, with Phase 5 focused purely on enhancement and polish.
