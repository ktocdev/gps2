## 🔍 **Phase 4.5: Polish & Testing**

**Status:** 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**
**Priority:** HIGH
**Goal:** Manual gameplay testing, balance adjustments, metadata fixes, and UI polish before Phase 5

### Critical Bug Fixes 🔥

#### Wellness Calculation Always at 0% ⚠️ **CRITICAL**
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** 📋 Not Started

**Issue:** Wellness meter stuck at 0% despite needs being satisfied

**Investigation Needed:**
- Check wellness calculation formula in needsController.ts
- Verify needs are being read correctly for wellness calculation
- Test with manual need adjustments to see if wellness responds
- Check for division by zero or incorrect averaging

**Files to Check:**
- `src/stores/needsController.ts` - Wellness calculation
- `src/stores/guineaPigStore.ts` - Need values and wellness integration

---

### Food System Rebalancing 🍎

#### Food Serving Amounts 📋 **Planned**
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** 📋 Not Started

**Current Issue:** All food items default to generic serving counts

**New Serving Amounts:**

**Vegetables (varies):**
- 🥕 Carrots: 4 servings per item
- 🥒 Cucumber: 6 servings per item
- 🥬 Zucchini: 6 servings per item
- 🌿 Celery: 6 servings per item
- 🥦 Broccoli: 4 servings per item
- 🍅 Cherry Tomato: 1 servings per item

**Fruits (varies):**
- 🍎 Apple: 4 servings per item
- 🍓 Strawberry: 1 serving per item
- 🫐 Blueberry: 1 serving per item
- 🍌 Banana: 4 servings per item
- 🍉 Melon: 6 servings per item

- 🍐 Pear: 4 servings per item

**Herbs & Greens:**
- 🌿 Herbs: ~6 servings per bunch (current value OK)
- 🥬 Greens: ~6 servings per bunch (current value OK)

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/data/supplies/food/*.json` - Update `servings` field for each food item
- Test inventory consumption and food bowl mechanics with new values

---

#### Food Activity Messages 📋 **Planned**
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Status:** 📋 Not Started

**Current Issue:** Activity messages say generic "ate [food]" for all foods

**New Message Format:**
- **All fruits and vegetables:** "[Guinea pig name] ate a [food] piece"
  - Example: "Cinnamon ate a carrot piece"
  - Example: "Hazel ate a banana piece"
  - Example: "Butterscotch ate an apple piece"
  - Example: "Peanut ate a blueberry piece"
  - Example: "Mocha ate a cherry tomato piece"

**Implementation:**
- Update food consumption messages to use "a [food] piece" format
- Article handling (a/an) for piece messages
- Apply to all fruits and vegetables consistently

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/utils/messageGenerator.ts` - Update food consumption messages

---

#### Poop Activity Messages 📋 **Planned**
**Priority:** LOW
**Status:** 📋 Not Started

**Current Issue:** Poop messages say "left poop near the floor" which doesn't make sense

**Examples of Current Bad Messages:**
- "Cinnamon left poop near the floor"
- "Hazel left poop near the hideaway"

**New Message Format:**
- Remove location references entirely for poop
- Simple message: "[Guinea pig name] left a poop"
- Or alternative: "[Guinea pig name] pooped"

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/utils/messageGenerator.ts` - Update poop behavior messages
- Remove location parameter from poop message generation

---

### UI/UX Improvements 🎨

#### Auto-Select Guinea Pig in Debug Panels 📋 **Planned**
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Status:** 📋 Not Started

**Goal:** Clicking a guinea pig sprite should automatically switch Autonomy Controls and Needs Panel to that guinea pig

**Current Behavior:**
- Clicking guinea pig shows selection ring
- Must manually toggle between guinea pigs in debug panels
- No connection between sprite selection and panel focus

**New Behavior:**
- Clicking guinea pig sprite selects it (existing)
- Automatically switches Autonomy Controls panel to that guinea pig
- Automatically switches Needs Panel to that guinea pig
- Visual feedback showing which guinea pig is selected in panels

**Implementation:**
- Listen for guinea pig selection change in HabitatVisual
- Update `selectedGuineaPigIndex` in both AutonomyDebug and NeedsPanel
- Emit event or use shared state for selection sync

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/components/game/habitat/HabitatVisual.vue` - Emit selection event
- `src/components/debug/environment/AutonomyDebug.vue` - Listen for selection
- `src/components/debug/environment/NeedsPanel.vue` - Listen for selection
- Consider creating shared selection state in behaviorStateStore

---

#### Social Bonding Empty State 📋 **Planned**
**Priority:** LOW
**Status:** 📋 Not Started

**Issue:** Social Bonding page shows empty/broken UI when no game session active

**Goal:** Display helpful message when no guinea pigs in game

**Message:**
```
No guinea pigs in game

Start a game session from the Guinea Pigs page to see social bonding data.
```

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/components/debug/gameplay/FriendshipDebug.vue` - Add empty state check

### Realism & Balance Rules 📐

#### Create Realism Guidelines 📋 **Planned**
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Status:** 📋 Not Started

**Goal:** Document realistic guinea pig care guidelines for game balance

**Topics to Cover:**
1. **Feeding Frequency & Amounts**
   - How often should guinea pigs need food/water?
   - What's a realistic hunger cycle duration?
   - Hay should be unlimited - guinea pigs graze constantly

2. **Sleep Patterns**
   - Guinea pigs sleep in short bursts (5-10 minutes)
   - 4-6 hours total sleep per day
   - More active at dawn/dusk (crepuscular)

3. **Social Behavior**
   - Guinea pigs are highly social - need companionship
   - Bonding takes weeks/months in real life
   - Play behaviors: popcorning, zoomies, following, grooming

4. **Hygiene & Maintenance**
   - Self-grooming is frequent (multiple times per day)
   - Nails grow slowly (~monthly trimming in real life)
   - Poop frequently (100+ times per day!)
   - Clean habitat reduces stress

5. **Habitat Preferences**
   - Need hiding places for security
   - Enjoy tunnels and exploration
   - Sensitive to cleanliness (varies by personality)
   - Temperature and noise sensitivity

**Output:** Create [game-design/guinea-pig-realism-guide.md](game-design/guinea-pig-realism-guide.md)

### Adoption System Enhancement 🐹

#### Pre-Bonded Pairs & Solo Guinea Pigs 📋 **Planned**
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** 📋 Not Started

**Goal:** Implement adoption constraints for bonded pairs and solo-suitable guinea pigs with enhanced observation system

**Core Rules:**
1. **Bonded Pairs Must Be Adopted Together**
   - Guinea pigs with existing bonds in the pet store must be adopted as a pair
   - User cannot adopt just one of a bonded pair
   - Adoption will be denied until user selects both bonded guinea pigs
   - Error message: "These guinea pigs are bonded and must be adopted together"

2. **Solo Guinea Pig Rules**
   - Some guinea pigs are suited to be solo (marked as `suitableForSolo: true`)
   - Solo-suitable guinea pigs were found as solo rescues (backstory)
   - Non-solo guinea pigs CANNOT be adopted alone
   - User must either adopt a pair or adopt a solo-suitable guinea pig
   - Error message: "This guinea pig needs a companion. Select another guinea pig or choose one suited for solo living"

3. **Adoption Combinations Allowed:**
   - ✅ Bonded pair (both guinea pigs)
   - ✅ Two unbonded guinea pigs (any combination)
   - ✅ One solo-suitable guinea pig
   - ❌ One guinea pig from bonded pair
   - ❌ One non-solo-suitable guinea pig alone

**Enhanced Observation System:**

**3 Observation Clues per Guinea Pig:**
1. **Social/Bonding Clue** (NEW)
   - Reveals bonding information or solo suitability
   - Examples for bonded pairs:
     - "Seems very attached to [other guinea pig name]"
     - "Always stays close to [other guinea pig name]"
     - "Grooms [other guinea pig name] frequently"
   - Examples for solo-suitable:
     - "Prefers their own space"
     - "Was found living alone and seems content that way"
     - "Independent personality, doesn't seek companionship"
   - Examples for social but unbonded:
     - "Friendly and would enjoy a companion"
     - "Curious about other guinea pigs"
     - "Would do well with a friend"

2. **Personality Clue** (existing)
   - Reveals one personality trait
   - Examples: "Very playful", "Cautious and careful", "Bold explorer"

3. **Preference Clue** (existing)
   - Reveals one food preference
   - Examples: "Seems to enjoy carrots", "Not interested in apples"

**Habitat Constraints:**
- Bonded pairs can only be placed in habitat together (both or neither)
- Cannot mix bonded pairs in same habitat (e.g., can't have 4 guinea pigs if they're 2 separate bonded pairs)
- Unbonded guinea pigs can be mixed freely (existing behavior)

**Future Enhancement (noted for Phase 5+):**
- Allow multiple bonded pairs in same habitat (4+ guinea pigs)
- Complex social dynamics between multiple pairs
- Larger habitat sizes to accommodate more guinea pigs

**Implementation Tasks:**
- [ ] Add `bondedWith: string | null` field to GuineaPig type (stores partner's ID)
- [ ] Add `suitableForSolo: boolean` field to GuineaPig type
- [ ] Update pet store generation to create some bonded pairs (~20% of guinea pigs)
- [ ] Update pet store generation to mark some guinea pigs as solo-suitable (~10%)
- [ ] Add adoption validation logic in petStoreManager
- [ ] Add error messaging for invalid adoption attempts
- [ ] Expand observation system from 2 to 3 clues
- [ ] Add social/bonding clue generation logic
- [ ] Update habitat placement validation to enforce bonded pair rules
- [ ] Add UI indicators for bonded pairs in pet store (visual link or badge)
- [ ] Update guinea pig cards to show "Bonded with [name]" or "Suitable for solo living"

**Files to Modify:**
- `src/stores/guineaPigStore.ts` - Add bondedWith and suitableForSolo fields
- `src/stores/petStoreManager.ts` - Generation logic and adoption validation
- `src/utils/observationGenerator.ts` - Expand to 3 clues, add social clue logic
- `src/components/game/petstore/GuineaPigCard.vue` - Display bonding status
- `src/views/PetStoreView.vue` - Adoption validation and error messaging
- `src/views/GuineaPigsView.vue` - Habitat placement validation

**Testing:**
- [ ] Generate pet store with bonded pairs visible
- [ ] Attempt to adopt one of bonded pair (should fail)
- [ ] Adopt full bonded pair (should succeed)
- [ ] Attempt to adopt non-solo guinea pig alone (should fail)
- [ ] Adopt solo-suitable guinea pig alone (should succeed)
- [ ] Verify observation system shows all 3 clues
- [ ] Verify bonded pairs cannot be separated in habitat
