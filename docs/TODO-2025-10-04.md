## üß™ **Manual Testing**

**Status:** In Progress

### Testing Focus
- [ ] Validate all Phase 2 systems integration
- [ ] Test needs decay and wellness calculation
- [ ] Verify favorites system edge cases
- [ ] Check game timing and pause/resume
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verification

### Known Issues

**‚úÖ Pause/Resume Bug - Needs Decay Accumulation - FIXED**
- **Status:** Fixed (October 4, 2025)
- **Issue:** When pausing (via Game Controller or Needs System debug), needs continue to decay after unpausing
- **Root Cause:** Time delta accumulates during pause and applies all at once on resume
- **Fix:** Reset `needsLastUpdate` timestamps in [needsController.ts:202](src/stores/needsController.ts#L202) when `resumeProcessing()` is called
- **Impact:** High - core pause functionality now working correctly

**‚úÖ Activity Feed Not Showing Interaction Messages - FIXED**
- **Status:** Fixed (October 4, 2025)
- **Issue:** Quick actions (give water, soothe to sleep, etc.) don't show in Activity Feed
- **Root Cause:** `logActivity()` always logs to 'system' category which is filtered out of activity feed
- **Fix:** Changed all interaction methods to use `addPlayerAction()` with descriptive messages and emojis
- **Updated Methods:** feedGuineaPig, giveWater, cleanGuineaPig, playWithGuineaPig, provideChewToy, trimNails, provideShelter, sootheToSleep
- **Impact:** Medium - activity feed now shows all user interactions with guinea pigs

**‚úÖ Favorites Duplicate Bug - FIXED**
- **Status:** Fixed (October 4, 2025)
- **Issue:** Active guinea pigs can be favorited multiple times, creating duplicates; favorited guinea pigs disappeared from available list
- **Root Cause:** No duplicate check before adding to favorites, favorited non-active guinea pigs removed from available pool
- **Fix:**
  - Added duplicate check in [petStoreManager.ts:478](src/stores/petStoreManager.ts#L478) `addToFavorites()`
  - Changed behavior to keep ALL favorited guinea pigs in available pool (line 493-495)
  - Added `isGuineaPigFavorited()` helper in PetStoreDebug.vue
  - Disabled favorite button for already-favorited guinea pigs
  - Added "FAVORITED" badge to show visual status
- **Impact:** High - prevents data corruption, improves UX with consistent behavior for active and favorited guinea pigs

_(Add new findings from manual testing here)_

## üìù **Documentation Updates**

- [x] **Updated NEEDS_SYSTEM_TESTING_GUIDE.md** (October 4, 2025)
  - Clarified that need values are SATISFACTION levels (100% = satisfied, 0% = unsatisfied)
  - Updated all test steps to reflect correct satisfaction semantics
  - Fixed wellness calculation examples and expectations

## ‚ú® **Feature Enhancements**

### Enhanced Activity Feed Messages
- [x] **Implemented varied, interesting messages for quick actions** (October 4, 2025)

  - Each action now has 5+ varied message templates
  - Messages include guinea pig names for personalization
  - Special messages for favorite foods and activities
  - Updated all interaction methods in [guineaPigStore.ts](src/stores/guineaPigStore.ts) to use MessageGenerator
  - Examples:
    - "You fill Cocoa's water bottle with fresh water üíß"
    - "Cocoa gets their favorite: vegetables! ‚ú® ü•¨"
    - "You gently soothe Cocoa to sleep üò¥"
