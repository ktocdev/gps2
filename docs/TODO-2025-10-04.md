## ðŸ§ª **Manual Testing**

**Status:** In Progress

### Testing Focus
- [ ] Validate all Phase 2 systems integration
- [ ] Test needs decay and wellness calculation
- [ ] Verify favorites system edge cases
- [ ] Check game timing and pause/resume
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness verification

### Known Issues

**âœ… Pause/Resume Bug - Needs Decay Accumulation - FIXED**
- **Status:** Fixed (October 4, 2025)
- **Issue:** When pausing (via Game Controller or Needs System debug), needs continue to decay after unpausing
- **Root Cause:** Time delta accumulates during pause and applies all at once on resume
- **Fix:** Reset `needsLastUpdate` timestamps in [needsController.ts:202](src/stores/needsController.ts#L202) when `resumeProcessing()` is called
- **Impact:** High - core pause functionality now working correctly

**âœ… Activity Feed Not Showing Interaction Messages - FIXED**
- **Status:** Fixed (October 4, 2025)
- **Issue:** Quick actions (give water, allow rest, etc.) don't show in Activity Feed
- **Root Cause:** `logActivity()` always logs to 'system' category which is filtered out of activity feed
- **Fix:** Changed all interaction methods to use `addPlayerAction()` with descriptive messages and emojis
- **Updated Methods:** feedGuineaPig, giveWater, cleanGuineaPig, playWithGuineaPig, provideChewToy, trimNails, provideShelter, allowRest
- **Impact:** Medium - activity feed now shows all user interactions with guinea pigs

_(Add new findings from manual testing here)_

## ðŸŽ¨ **UI/UX Improvements**

### Details Component
- [ ] **Create Details component and use it in the sections of the Guinea Pig editor**
  - Reusable component for displaying guinea pig information
  - Use in editor sections for consistent presentation
  - Mobile-responsive design with BEM methodology
