## 📋 **Next Steps - Phase 3: Habitat & Environment**

**Status:** System 13 Foundation Complete ✅ - Restructuring Phase 3 Order 📋

### Phase 3 Architecture Update (October 14, 2025)

Phase 3 has been restructured to follow proper dependency flow: **Supplies Store → Inventory Management → Habitat Integration**

This approach establishes the proper data architecture where:
1. **Supplies Store** defines all purchasable items (catalog, pricing, metadata)
2. **Inventory System** tracks owned items and quantities
3. **Habitat Conditions** consumes inventory resources
4. **Habitat Items** uses inventory for placement
5. **Maintenance** affects conditions and consumes resources

**Updated Documentation:**
- ✅ [DEVELOPMENT_PHASES.md](DEVELOPMENT_PHASES.md) - Phase 3 restructured (Systems 11-15)
- ✅ [PROJECT_PLAN.md](PROJECT_PLAN.md) - Phase 3 references updated
- ✅ [SYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md](SYSTEM_INTEGRATION.md) - Supplies & Inventory dependencies added

## 🎯 **High Priority Improvements**

### Friendship System Redesign 🔥
**Priority:** HIGH (affects progression and sanctuary system)
**Goal:** Change friendship from percentage-based (0-100%) to infinite point-based progression

**Current System Issues:**
- Friendship is capped at 100%, limiting long-term progression
- Stardust Sanctuary uses 85% threshold, which feels arbitrary
- No incentive to continue building friendship after 100%

**New System Design:**
- **Point-Based Friendship:** Infinite points earned through interactions
- **Friendship Levels:** Tiered system (levels 1-10+) based on point thresholds
  - Level 1: 0-100 points
  - Level 2: 101-250 points
  - Level 3: 251-500 points
  - Level 4: 501-850 points ← **Stardust Sanctuary unlocks at Level 4**
  - Level 5+: Increasing thresholds (1200, 1800, 2500, 3500, 5000, 7500+)
- **Visual Display:** Show current level + progress bar to next level
- **Stardust Sanctuary:** Unlock at Level 4 (equivalent to current 85% threshold)

**Implementation:**
- Update `GuineaPig` interface to replace `friendship: number` (0-100) with `friendshipPoints: number` and `friendshipLevel: number`
- Create friendship level calculation function
- Update all friendship gain/loss to add/subtract points instead of percentages
- Update Stardust Sanctuary condition check (level >= 4 instead of >= 85%)
- Update UI displays to show level + progress bar
- Migrate existing friendship percentages to point equivalents (% * 10 = starting points)

**Files to Update:**
- `src/types/guineaPig.ts` - Update interface
- `src/stores/guineaPigStore.ts` - Update friendship logic
- `src/stores/petStoreManager.ts` - Update sanctuary check (level >= 4)
- `src/components/debug/GuineaPigEditor.vue` - Update friendship controls
- All components displaying friendship (show level instead of %)

**Backward Compatibility:**
- Migration function to convert existing friendship % → points (multiply by 10)
- Store persistence will handle conversion on load

---

### Port Real Food Items to Guinea Pig Preferences 🔥
**Priority:** HIGH (depends on Supplies Store completion)
**Goal:** Replace hardcoded food lists with actual items from Supplies Store catalog

**Current System Issues:**
- Food preferences use hardcoded arrays (`petStoreManager.vegetables`, `petStoreManager.fruits`, etc.)
- No connection to actual purchasable food items
- Disconnect between what can be bought and what guinea pigs prefer

**New System Design:**
- **After Supplies Store is built:** Update Guinea Pig Editor to use real food items
- Pull food lists from `suppliesStore` instead of `petStoreManager`
- Categories to port:
  - Fresh Greens (5 items)
  - Fresh Herbs (4 items)
  - Vegetables (5-7 items)
  - Fruits (5-6 items)
  - Pellets (3 tiers)
  - Premium Treats (3 items) - Special consideration for favorites

**Implementation:**
- Update `GuineaPigEditor.vue` to source food from `suppliesStore.getFoodByCategory()`
- Update preference generation in `petStoreManager` to use Supplies Store catalog
- Ensure favorite/disliked food IDs match Supplies Store item IDs
- Update feeding system to cross-reference Supplies Store for food stats

**Files to Update:**
- `src/components/debug/GuineaPigEditor.vue` - Update food selection dropdowns
- `src/stores/petStoreManager.ts` - Update preference generation to use Supplies Store
- `src/stores/guineaPigStore.ts` - Validate food IDs against Supplies Store

**Dependencies:**
- ✅ Must complete System 11: Supplies Store first
- ⏳ Requires `suppliesStore.ts` with full food catalog

**Testing:**
- Verify all existing guinea pigs' food preferences map to real items
- Test generating new guinea pigs with Supplies Store food items
- Ensure feeding system recognizes all food items

---

### Personality-Based Habitat Sensitivity (New Trait) 🔥
**Priority:** MEDIUM (enhances Phase 3 Habitat Systems)
**Goal:** Add 5th personality trait affecting guinea pig tolerance to habitat conditions

**New Cleanliness Personality Trait (1-10):**

**Picky/Particular (High Cleanliness 7-10):**
- **Finicky about freshness** - Reduced tolerance for stale hay, old bedding, dirty habitat
- **Higher standards** - Comfort need decays faster when habitat conditions drop below 60%
- **Hay freshness threshold** - Won't eat hay below 60% freshness (vs 40% baseline)
- **Bedding sensitivity** - Bedding freshness below 50% causes comfort penalties
- **Cleanliness stress** - Cage cleanliness below 50% causes anxiety (-5 to -10 comfort/hour)
- **Activity messages:**
  - "Guinea pig wrinkles nose at the stale hay"
  - "Guinea pig seems uncomfortable with the messy cage"
  - "Guinea pig appreciates the fresh, clean habitat!"

**Piggy/Unbothered (Low Cleanliness 1-3):**
- **Tolerant of mess** - Will eat hay down to 20% freshness (vs 40% baseline)
- **Unfazed by dirt** - Comfort need unaffected until cleanliness drops below 30%
- **Not picky** - Bedding freshness doesn't impact comfort until below 25%
- **Easy-going** - No stress penalties from habitat conditions unless critical (< 20%)
- **Activity messages:**
  - "Guinea pig happily munches the hay without concern"
  - "Guinea pig doesn't seem bothered by the messy cage"
  - "Guinea pig is content in any conditions"

**Moderate Cleanliness (4-6):**
- **Baseline behavior** - Standard thresholds (40% hay, 40% bedding, 40% cleanliness)
- **Balanced tolerance** - Neither finicky nor unbothered

**Cleanliness Modifiers:**
```typescript
// Hay freshness eating threshold
hayFreshnessThreshold = {
  picky (7-10): 60%      // Won't eat below this
  moderate (4-6): 40%    // Baseline
  piggy (1-3): 20%       // Very tolerant
}

// Comfort penalty from poor cleanliness
if (cleanliness < cleanlinessThreshold) {
  const cleanlinessPersonality = guineaPig.personality.cleanliness
  if (cleanlinessPersonality >= 7) {
    // Picky: starts penalties at 50%, severe at 30%
    comfortPenalty = (50 - cleanliness) * 0.3
  } else if (cleanlinessPersonality <= 3) {
    // Piggy: only penalized below 30%, mild penalties
    comfortPenalty = cleanliness < 30 ? (30 - cleanliness) * 0.1 : 0
  } else {
    // Moderate: baseline penalties starting at 40%
    comfortPenalty = (40 - cleanliness) * 0.2
  }
}

// Bedding freshness comfort impact
if (beddingFreshness < beddingThreshold) {
  if (cleanlinessPersonality >= 7) {
    // Picky: uncomfortable with bedding < 50%
    beddingPenalty = (50 - beddingFreshness) * 0.2
  } else if (cleanlinessPersonality <= 3) {
    // Piggy: only cares below 25%
    beddingPenalty = beddingFreshness < 25 ? (25 - beddingFreshness) * 0.1 : 0
  }
}
```

**Implementation:**
- Add `cleanliness: number` (1-10) to `Personality` interface in `guineaPig.ts`
- Update guinea pig generation to include cleanliness trait (random 1-10)
- Implement threshold calculation functions in `habitatConditions.ts`
- Add comfort penalty calculations based on cleanliness personality
- Update hay eating logic to check freshness thresholds
- Add cleanliness-specific activity messages to `messageGenerator.ts`

**Debug Panel Display:**
- **Cleanliness Trait Slider** - Adjust 1-10 for testing
- **Current Thresholds Display** - Show active hay/bedding/cleanliness thresholds based on personality
- **Penalty Visualization** - Real-time comfort penalties from habitat conditions
- **Personality Type Label:**
  - "Picky Princess" (9-10)
  - "Particular Pig" (7-8)
  - "Balanced" (4-6)
  - "Easy-Going" (2-3)
  - "Total Piggy" (1)

**Files to Update:**

### Feeding System Realism Enhancement 🔥
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Goal:** Add realistic eating behaviors with timing and partial consumption

**Features to Add:**
- **Eating Duration:** Different foods take different times to eat
  - Hay: 10+ seconds (grazing behavior), may leave leftovers
  - Leafy greens (lettuce, kale): 5-8 seconds, partial eating/grazing
  - Crunchy vegetables (carrot, pepper): 8-12 seconds, may nibble and leave
  - Fruits: 3-5 seconds, consumed completely
  - Treats: 2-3 seconds, consumed completely
  - Pellets: 5-8 seconds, consumed completely

- **Partial Consumption:**
  - Hay: Guinea pig may eat 30-70% and leave rest
  - Leafy vegetables: May eat 50-100% depending on preference
  - Root vegetables: May nibble and return multiple times
  - Track "leftover food" that can be eaten later

- **Eating Animations/Status:**
  - Show "Eating [food]..." status during consumption
  - Visual feedback in activity feed with progress
  - Eating sound/behavior indicators

- **Realistic Feeding Mechanics:**
  - Guinea pigs don't eat if not hungry enough (< 30% hunger?)
  - Favorite foods more likely to be eaten completely
  - Disliked foods may be rejected or partially eaten
  - Multiple guinea pigs can eat at the same time

**Implementation Notes:**
- Add `eatingState` to guinea pig (food being eaten, start time, duration)
- Create eating timer system in needsController
- Update feedGuineaPig to start eating timer instead of instant satisfaction
- Add eating completion callback to apply hunger satisfaction
- Track partial food items in habitat/inventory
- Create "Eating Status" display in debug panels

**Files to Update:**
- `src/stores/guineaPigStore.ts` - Add eating state tracking
- `src/stores/needsController.ts` - Add eating timer logic
- `src/components/debug/FeedingDebug.vue` - Show eating status
- `src/utils/messageGenerator.ts` - Add eating progress messages
