- activity messages lag after the activity completes
- item tooltips (like for chews) get cut off in the habitat grid because of overflow: hidden
- z-index issues with the tooltip and guinea pig sprite and items like, tooltip going beneath 
- when we pause, the guinea pig continues on its path and finishes the task. pause should dead stop all movement and freeze it
- water should have a info tooltip with % of water remaining and refill button
- all activity messages should end with a period
- after letting the game run a while, the guinea pigs failed to sleep on their own and their energy need fell to 0. verify autonomous sleep seeking is set up 
- Snowball investigates a toy with curiosity - improve play message by adding toy name to it
- Same with shelter messages, and all other object interactions
- chews are showing two tooltips. we only want the one with the action buttons
- when pushing the ball, can we have the guinea pig actually move the ball across come grid cells. we might need a way to track "pushable" toys so that this can be done to anything pushable
