# Habitat Conditions System - Environmental Management

## Overview
Environmental management system separate from guinea pig needs, creating resource management gameplay and habitat maintenance responsibilities that affect guinea pig wellbeing.

## Core Habitat Conditions (Separate from Guinea Pig Needs)

### Cleanliness Level (0-100)
- **Decay mechanism:** Decreases as poops accumulate in cage over time
- **Restoration method:** Cleaning cage action fully restores cleanliness to 100%
- **Visual representation:** Grid-based poop placement with accumulation tracking
- **Player control:** Direct player action required to maintain cleanliness

### Bedding Freshness (0-100)
- **Decay mechanism:** Gradually decays over time regardless of guinea pig activity
- **Restoration method:** Consuming bedding resource from player inventory
- **Resource dependency:** Requires purchased bedding materials for maintenance
- **Quality variation:** Different bedding types offer different longevity and effects

### Water Level (0-100)
- **Consumption mechanism:** Decreases when guinea pig drinks to satisfy thirst
- **Restoration method:** Free refill via "Refresh Water" action
- **Infinite resource:** No cost or inventory constraint for water maintenance
- **Accessibility design:** Simplest maintenance task to encourage proper care

## Resource Management Strategy

### Bedding as Consumable Resource
- **Purchase requirement:** Players must buy bedding from store with game currency
- **Variety system:** Multiple bedding types with different costs, duration, and effects
- **Economic pressure:** Creates ongoing expense requiring budget management
- **Strategic choices:** Balance cost vs quality vs guinea pig preferences

### Starter Supply System
- **New player support:** Begin game with initial bedding inventory
- **Learning buffer:** Prevents immediate resource pressure during tutorial phase
- **Gradual introduction:** Allows players to learn system before facing constraints
- **Transition planning:** Guides players toward sustainable resource management

### Water as Infinite Resource
- **Accessibility focus:** No cost or constraint to refill water bottle
- **Encourages proper care:** Removes barriers to essential guinea pig care
- **Simplicity balance:** One maintenance task that's always available
- **Health priority:** Ensures hydration never becomes economic issue

### Strategic Budgeting Gameplay
- **Resource allocation:** Balance bedding costs against other purchases
- **Competing priorities:** Toys, treats, decorations compete with essential maintenance
- **Planning requirement:** Anticipate future bedding needs for efficient purchasing
- **Economic consequences:** Poor planning leads to guinea pig care challenges

## Environmental Impact on Guinea Pig

### Habitat-to-Needs Integration
- **Direct need effects:** Poor habitat conditions negatively affect specific guinea pig needs
- **System separation:** Habitat conditions distinct from but influence guinea pig needs
- **Indirect consequences:** Environmental neglect creates guinea pig welfare issues
- **Player responsibility:** Must manage both direct care and environmental conditions

### Specific Impact Mechanisms

#### Cleanliness Impact
- **Guinea pig cleanliness need:** Low cage cleanliness affects guinea pig's personal cleanliness
- **Health implications:** Dirty conditions can accelerate health need decay
- **Behavioral effects:** Guinea pig may show stress reactions to dirty environment
- **Recovery benefits:** Clean environment supports faster cleanliness need recovery

#### Bedding Impact
- **Happiness reduction:** Stale bedding reduces guinea pig happiness and comfort
- **Sleep quality:** Poor bedding affects energy need satisfaction during rest
- **Preference integration:** Some guinea pigs prefer specific bedding types
- **Comfort factors:** Fresh bedding provides happiness bonuses and comfort

#### Water Impact
- **Thirst prevention:** Empty water bottle prevents guinea pig from satisfying thirst need
- **Critical dependency:** Water availability essential for basic survival needs
- **Immediate consequences:** Thirst need cannot be satisfied without adequate water
- **Health effects:** Dehydration accelerates other need deterioration

### Compound Effect System
- **Multiple condition impacts:** Poor conditions in several areas create severe effects
- **Wellness rating influence:** Habitat conditions contribute to overall wellness calculation
- **Cascading consequences:** Environmental neglect affects multiple guinea pig systems
- **Recovery synergy:** Improving multiple conditions provides enhanced benefits

## Maintenance Gameplay Loop

### Proactive Care Requirements
- **Anticipation gameplay:** Players must predict and prevent habitat deterioration
- **Routine development:** Establish sustainable maintenance patterns
- **Crisis avoidance:** Proactive care prevents emergency situations
- **Planning skills:** Learn to balance immediate needs with long-term maintenance

### Resource Planning Strategy
- **Inventory management:** Track bedding quantities and consumption rates
- **Budget allocation:** Plan bedding purchases within overall economic strategy
- **Efficiency optimization:** Learn to maximize bedding effectiveness and longevity
- **Emergency preparation:** Maintain buffer supplies for unexpected situations

### Multi-System Balance
- **Complexity layers:** Habitat maintenance adds depth beyond direct guinea pig care
- **Priority management:** Balance habitat needs with direct interaction needs
- **Time allocation:** Distribute attention between maintenance and engagement
- **System mastery:** Advanced players efficiently manage all habitat systems

### Visual Feedback System
- **Color-coded indicators:** Habitat status displayed with clear visual cues
- **Priority guidance:** Help players identify most urgent maintenance needs
- **Progress tracking:** Show improvement results from maintenance actions
- **Accessibility features:** Clear visual communication of habitat condition status

## Gameplay Design Philosophy

### Environmental Responsibility
- **Realistic pet ownership:** Habitat maintenance mirrors real pet care requirements
- **Comprehensive care:** Cannot focus solely on direct interaction, must manage environment
- **Long-term thinking:** Environmental neglect has gradual but serious consequences
- **Holistic approach:** Successful care requires attention to all aspects of guinea pig environment

### Economic Integration
- **Resource scarcity:** Limited bedding creates meaningful economic decisions
- **Budget pressure:** Ongoing expenses require sustainable economic strategy
- **Value optimization:** Players learn to balance cost vs effectiveness
