- **Visual hierarchy:** Clear but not overwhelming, supporting primary gameplay

### Real-Time Updates
- **Immediate text feedback:** Instant descriptions for all interactions and behaviors
- **Synchronized messaging:** Messages appear simultaneously with game events
- **Smooth integration:** Messages flow naturally without disrupting gameplay
- **Performance optimization:** Efficient message queuing and display management

### Natural Language Communication
- **Human-readable descriptions:** Conversational and engaging message style
- **Personality reflection:** Messages reflect guinea pig's individual character
- **Contextual detail:** Rich information about interactions and responses
- **Emotional connection:** Language that builds attachment to guinea pig

### Categorized Message System
- **Player actions:** User interactions with guinea pig and environment
- **Guinea pig reactions:** Behavioral responses and emotional expressions
- **Autonomous behaviors:** Independent guinea pig activities and decisions
- **Environmental events:** Habitat conditions and maintenance notifications

## Activity Message Examples

### Player Interactions
Clear descriptions of user actions:
- **Feeding:** "You place a cherry tomato in the food dish"
- **Treating:** "You offer your guinea pig a strawberry treat"
- **Affection:** "You gently pet your guinea pig behind the ears"
- **Maintenance:** "You clean the cage thoroughly"
- **Care:** "You refresh the bedding with botanical hay"

### Guinea Pig Reactions (Preference Discovery)
Behavioral responses that teach player about preferences:
- **Excitement:** "Guinea pig popcorns excitedly! ✨" (favorite food discovery)
- **Rejection:** "Guinea pig turns nose up at the broccoli" (disliked food identification)
- **Satisfaction:** "Guinea pig munches happily - nom nom nom!" (preferred hay confirmation)
- **Affection:** "Guinea pig purrs contentedly during petting" (enjoys physical affection)
- **Anticipation:** "Guinea pig wheeks loudly for more treats!" (food excitement)

### Autonomous Behaviors
Independent guinea pig activities:
- **Basic needs:** "Guinea pig runs to the water bottle and drinks"
- **Exploration:** "Guinea pig investigates the new tunnel curiously"
- **Play:** "Guinea pig does zoomies around the cage!"
- **Rest:** "Guinea pig stretches and yawns in the sunbeam"
- **Comfort:** "Guinea pig hides in the cozy shelter"

### Environmental Events
Habitat and maintenance notifications:
- **Maintenance needs:** "The bedding freshness is getting low"
- **Cleanliness events:** "Guinea pig drops a poop near the food dish"
- **Resource alerts:** "Water level needs attention"
- **Care reminders:** "The cage could use a good cleaning"
